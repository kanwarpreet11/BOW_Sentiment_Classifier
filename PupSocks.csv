PupSocks,2021-02-11T03:57:30+00:00,5,"We ordered socks for our kids with their 2 pooches of which one has passed. They LOVE them, I think it may be the best gift that they have received for Christmas-  better than cash! Plus, the shipping was very, very fast!"
PupSocks,2021-02-10T22:52:30+00:00,5,"The socks look amazing! They did a great job incorporating my pictures I submitted of my dog. I got this as a gift for my wife and she loves how they look! In her words, ""they're soooo cute"".I do also want to give a shout out to the service I received as well. I ordered in November and due to post office issues there was a large delay. By mid January, Pupsocks contacted me to state that they were re-sending my order as it was clear something had gone awry with the post office. The initiative on their part to do this was awesome.Only critique from my wife is the shape. The socks do not narrow any at the  mid foot and are a bit tight at the top. She is a 6.5 and I ordered the Womens 4-8 size. However, this most likely won't be a problem because she says their so cute she doesn't even want to use them!"
PupSocks,2021-02-10T15:51:15+00:00,5,Great product ! My daughter an RVT loved them as a  gift. Note ordering socks recommend ordering a size down. Size S socks was a little larger than expected but still great nonetheless.
PupSocks,2021-02-09T20:37:14+00:00,1,"Received email advertisements to make orders by a certain date to recieve before Christmas. Made my order on Nov 25th a few days before ""deadline."" Here it is Feb 9th...Christmas came and passed. On Dec 21st a pre-drafted mass email was sent out blaming any late orders on USPS...figured there might be a slow-down, because its Christmas (fair enough). I sent a response email with my order number to help track where mine might be. Response back was after Christmas (Jan 6th) speaking to unforseen high volumes of emails cluttering customer service. My order was found still being processed in production... not lost in shipping by another entity. In the time since my original order I have received about 45 advertisement emails for additional orders and products... seems as though the marketing department is over staffed while the production department is in the under."
PupSocks,2021-02-09T13:25:11+00:00,5,"Follow up was awesome! The post office was slow to deliver,and you sent us a free pair.They loved it!"
PupSocks,2021-02-09T01:23:49+00:00,1,My blanket sheds. We've washed it several times. I had an email thread going and No one ever got back to me and I spent a lot of money on the Christmas gift that is not being used. So frustrating. I also bought socks. Looks cool but so uncomfortable. I dont even know what is happening with the material with this company.  They must be taking in money because the quality is cheap it's so expensive and lord knows there will be no refunds.
PupSocks,2021-02-08T20:24:57+00:00,5,"The socks turned out absolutely darling! I was expecting them to touch base with me regarding the mock-up but they seemed to understand what I wanted, so there was no need. Also, when it looked like the socks were not going to make it for Christmas they sent a picture of the socks so that I had something to give for a gift. They socks were delivered not long after Christmas."
PupSocks,2021-02-08T18:30:43+00:00,2,"The images on the socks were spot on and super cute. However, the socks themselves were not socks. The material is unwearable and I feel the money was wasted on these socks."
PupSocks,2021-02-08T12:44:08+00:00,1,If I could give a negative rating I would.  I had two separate orders.  Besides being late - I was satisfied with one order.  The other order was late as well but do to the pandemeic I know the shipping is not in their control. A mask I ordered came with a flaw in it and I just wanted it fixed.  It's been TWO months and the Customer service has been extremely awful and unacceptable.  It takes weeks before someone will email me.  I asked for a phone number so I can speak with someone and they won't give me one.  I been very polite and friendly but NOW IM FED UP!   I DO NOT RECOMMEND.
PupSocks,2021-02-08T00:28:24+00:00,5,Thank you pup socks for making an excellent Christmas stocking stuffers with our cat's face on the socks and masks. Made a stocking stuffer from boring into extraordinary!
PupSocks,2021-02-07T21:34:34+00:00,2,"I ordered a pair for a family member in the US and they arrived. So I decided to order 2 and 4 pairs for my family and to friends in BC (Canada). This was in November. The first set’s shipping notification’s suddenly stopped, and I sent an inquiry to their customer service and they were utterly useless. They kept asking for more information, and after sending the order number, shipping tracking number, and even our Paypal transaction numbers, they still couldn’t find our order. So I called the shipping company to no avail, but after 2 months the first order showed finally showed up. The issue with the second order is ongoing, as we were hoping for Christmas delivery for a Dec. 1st order, and it’s now February. The $100 in socks are MIA, and we do get shipping updates which indicate they made it into the country, but were somehow redirected back to a shipping depot in the US. The company did send an e-mail that we sent to our friends on Dec. 24th, but more than a month later, I suppose the gesture of a Christmas gift is gone. Maybe they will arrive in time for Spring?!!!"
PupSocks,2021-02-07T17:00:38+00:00,1,"i received a shipped email but no tracking number or date of expected delivery, very fishy so i emailed, messaged on Facebook and instagram and NO REPLY! all you get is daily marketing emails and auto replies mentioning the same email to contact (the one that no one replies to). waiting to know if this company is a scam and just bought all their followers. will definitely expose if this is true"
PupSocks,2021-02-07T16:41:50+00:00,1,"Sent the wrong socks and wanted a photo sent to them of the socks I received like I was scamming them for a second pair.  Finally received correct socks after two months.  Worst pair of socks ever.  Straight sock, no heel bend so they bunch and slide during first wearing.  Love the idea but give a better company your money."
PupSocks,2021-02-07T13:59:04+00:00,1,They sent the wrong socks (not my dog). I emailed customer service and sent them pic of socks I got.  They said they would send correct ones with 7-10 days but it’s been almost 2 months and they won’t respond to any of my emails.  Very poor customer service.  Interesting I get promo emails every couple days but can’t get anyone live to correct this.
PupSocks,2021-02-07T13:20:04+00:00,1,"There were several issues regarding my order. The biggest one was that it got lost and was never delivered to the person I ordered it for. He contacted pup socks and they said they’ll deal with it but he never got a further update. The shipping dates on their website are incorrect. I was surprised to see that they ship internationally so fast while corona is going on, but after my payment was processed there was a message on the screen that instead of advertised 10 business days I think, it’s going to be up to 35. The tracking number they gave me with asendia doesn’t work. It constantly says the package has left the US and there are no further updates... since November! Yet I know the package has arrived to Austria since my partner had to pay 25 euro customs fee because they didn’t include a receipt into the package. I’ve sent them a few emails with other questions a few months back, and got no reply as well. I’ve sent them another email prior to this review and got no reply. So to sum up, 3 months wait, lost 100 dollar order, 25 euro customs fee because they didn’t include a receipt in the package, company is non responsive. So my suggestion would be to order from another company. There’s plenty of places where you can get custom prints on socks and blankets."
PupSocks,2021-02-06T21:55:00+00:00,1,"We received socks with random pets on them, not our dogs' pictures. Tried many times to contact the company, and only received automated messages saying volume was high due to COVID. I ordered these in mid December for Christmas. Almost two months later, I have not received the socks I ordered, nor have I been refunded."
PupSocks,2021-02-06T19:04:21+00:00,1,Still have not received the order yet.  3 months
PupSocks,2021-02-06T16:50:46+00:00,1,"The 4 pairs of socks that I ordered for my family are one of the worst purchases I've ever made. The socks are thin and made out of unbearable material. I should have read the fine print. Both my husband and daughter tried them on and concluded that these are socks that they will never wear. There is legitimately no designated place for the heel and toes. Seriously, these are not socks. They are formless and shapeless hunks of polyester blend. What the heck people? Our pets are cute, but no pet is THIS cute (unwearable socks cute). I seriously do not understand how a company could claim the product that we received able to be worn by humans, or animals, for that matter. The company offered to give me a store credit which I find ridiculous. There is absolutely nothing I wish to purchase from PupSocks. A company should stand by its products. I am incredibly disappointed. Buyer beware."
PupSocks,2021-02-06T15:20:12+00:00,1,I wouldn’t give them 1 star!  A rip off company. Outrageous to advertise such cute products that would make great gifts knowing you never produce! NO customer service!  I never received socks I ordered and paid for back in November.  I repeatedly contacted customer service and would NEVER receive a response.  After negative posts on Facebook I finally received a message from customer service stating they would be “happy” to refund my money!  That is a laugh! Never received any follow on messages nor have I yet to see a refund.  Be sure to check BBB. They have numerous complaints. How can this company still be in business?! Outrageous!
PupSocks,2021-02-06T10:12:38+00:00,4,"With covid and the holidays, my order came later than anticipated. However, the recipients were overjoyed by the quality of the prints and that made it worthwhile. I would definitely order again."
PupSocks,2021-02-05T02:58:47+00:00,1,Sock cropping is terrible! The heel crease is halfway up on the sock and they are essentially un-wearable!
PupSocks,2021-02-05T02:05:34+00:00,1,Warning to future purchasers! Do not buy! My pup socks arrived 3 weeks late and the quality was absolute garbage. Such a scam. Find a better company. There are many that do the same thing and probably much better.
PupSocks,2021-02-04T19:47:36+00:00,5,These pup socks are made of excellent quality. I highly recommend!!!
PupSocks,2021-02-04T19:23:16+00:00,1,It’s been 2 months and I haven’t received my order.
PupSocks,2021-02-04T16:27:41+00:00,1,My order didnt arrive
PupSocks,2021-02-04T01:38:50+00:00,2,"The socks are a great idea, however, they are horrible in execution. The ""material"" has a rough, rubbery feel. The cut of the sock does not look like it can be worn on a human foot. The toe box is big and square and does not fit comfortably into a shoe or sneaker. For the price of these, I really expected something better."
PupSocks,2021-02-03T22:23:50+00:00,1,"These socks took almost 2 months to arrive and they are like hospital socks-they have no built in heel. They are so uncomfortable. So disappointed in this product. So sad for my kids, I ordered one pair with our dog on them for our son, and one pair for my daughter with her cat on them. They won’t even wear them because they are uncomfortable and bunch up at the top bend of the foot. Do not buy!!"
PupSocks,2021-02-03T19:14:19+00:00,2,"I received a pair of PupSocks 2 years ago as a gift and just LOVED them!  Soft, fitted, comfortable socks, with my dog's cute face on them.  This year, I ordered 2 pairs of socks (1 for me, 1 for a family member) and was so SHOCKED.  Yes, the face of my dog was clear and the color was what I chose...but the fabric was HARSH and uncomfortable and I was SO disappointed at the feel of the itchy fabric and the fact that there is NO great fit to these socks.  When I inquired of the change to a CSA, they replied that I could get a refund (-$9 )and I just wanted to know if the fabric had changed...that's all.  I asked a different way...is the product different than 2 years ago? The CSA replied with the fabric's material.  NOT what I wanted.  So, they used to be so good!  Now, I don't even want to wear the new ones. They stink.  Boo hoo on PupSocks."
PupSocks,2021-02-03T17:48:57+00:00,1,"I just received my pupsocks days ago after waiting a horrendously long time (post issue not Pupsocks fault)... I was forced to choose one star above but honestly, that is a stretch... The product is of extremely poor quality, the sizing is ridiculous (I just don't know who has feet that wide so they will never fit my daughter), the texture is unpleasant... When I reached out to the company, I got a blanket response which more or less stated ""thanks for your feedback"" with no effort to turn my experience around... My intention was to order future products, blanket & pillow but that will never happen now as this company clearly only cares about taking your money, whether your happy with their products is not important to them...My advice, keep searching if you are looking for a good sock product and a company that cares!"
PupSocks,2021-02-03T16:00:29+00:00,1,"I placed an order for a blanket in November - to give to my mother as a Christmas gift.  After two weeks, I started checking for updates.  None.  Contacted customer service...no response.  Contacted again...nothing.  Then I saw a post on Instagram from the CEO begging for pity and forgiveness due Covid shipping issues.  That would have been the end of it for me EXCEPT that I still got DAILY marketing spam emails from Pupsocks.com, up until December 23rd (a MONTH after I placed and paid for my original order) guaranteeing that if I placed another order, the new one would actually arrive within 48 hours.  Seriously?  Needless to day, my mother's showed up in mid-January and it's a $100 piece of low-quality garbage.  And my FAVORITE part of this miserable experience would be...Justin Lyles in the ""Resolution Department"".  He sent me an email yesterday letting me know MY order had been received...by ME!  Okay Justin - thanks for the newsflash, Chief.   and to email him directly if I had any further concerns.  So I tried and the icing on this crap cake is that he gave a FAKE email address in his signature line.  Message is still sitting in my outbox and cannot be delivered as ""sender in unknown"".  DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY.  The quality sucks, the customer service is AWFUL, and the constant scamming (like not posting the thousands of one star reviews that customers just like me  provided - just the four and five star ones) on their website.  Such a disgusting company.  You've been warned!"
PupSocks,2021-02-03T15:45:44+00:00,1,"In November I ordered a blanket for my daughter for Christmas with a picture of our cat printed on it. In December I received a blanket with a picture of two dogs, not our dogs. I tried to contact Pupsocks with no luck so I tried a charge back at PayPal. I got a response from Pupsocks with the delivery confirmation. Yes, I received a blanket with two dogs, not my dogs. As a matter of fact after the dog blanket arrived I received a confirmation email showing the blanket with a picture of the cat telling me it was shipping soon.  Yes, I received a delivery. A blanket with someone  else's dogs that only cost me $80 for a blanket I could buy at Walmart for $10. Case closed. No kitten blanket for my daughter. PS, the blanket is poor quality."
PupSocks,2021-02-03T15:15:49+00:00,1,TERRIBLE customer serviceOrder was placed two months ago and still have not arrived
PupSocks,2021-02-03T13:52:01+00:00,5,Ordered a blanket for my kiddo for Christmas and it thankfully got here on time (postal issue not Pupsocks). Blanket had some staining on it and they sent a replacement. Communication was great and customer service made it right! Thank you for your amazing products and customer service!
PupSocks,2021-02-02T22:12:18+00:00,4,"My niece really loved the blanket and the quality is really nice. But, the lack of communication and time to receive definitely will make me think twice about future orders."
PupSocks,2021-02-02T20:17:19+00:00,2,The material the socks are made of is gross. Not comfortable at all and awkward once on your foot. Very disappointed as the socks will not be worn and were too expensive for this type of material
PupSocks,2021-02-02T02:45:13+00:00,3,"Great quality, the socks came out perfect! I got a $70 blanket and the picture came out horrible. The way the cropped it made my dogs ears look like chicken wings. I emailed them about it and they sent me the same blanket again. Honesty will just stick to socks if I get anything from here again. I appreciate the effort of sending my another blanket but now I just have two okay looking blankets... I ordered the blanket for Christmas and didn’t want to give it as a present because it looked so funny."
PupSocks,2021-02-02T02:00:44+00:00,1,I still have not received my Order. Was/am very excited about purchase however very disappointed about shipping details
PupSocks,2021-02-01T16:35:24+00:00,2,Socks do not fit appropriately. Foot fit is good but can not pull up because they are too tight. My husband is average weight and height.
PupSocks,2021-02-01T05:51:37+00:00,3,"The PupSocks are an adorable gift!! Got them last Christmas for my kids.  The socks came out great!  (Reason for only 3 stars)I bought 2 pair this year for my Mrs (of the kitties) and one came out great!  The 2nd not so much- the socks I chose were to have 2 faces (taken from one picture I submitted). I selected 1 image, and rather than using the pic as I submitted , they cropped out one of the kitty’s faces.  So they are cute, BUT not what I wanted."
PupSocks,2021-01-31T19:55:11+00:00,1,"DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY!! I ordered back in November for a Christmas present and when I received it in December, they sent me the completely wrong order! I requested a refund and they offered to send a new pair or store credit which I didn’t want either because it took them a week and a half to respond to their error so I already placed an order with someone else. I told them I wanted a refund and they said they will issue one within 48 hours and if I don’t get an email with a refund confirmation to write back to them. Refund was NEVER received and I’ve been writing to them for a month and a half now with no response!THIS COMPANY IS A SCAM !!"
PupSocks,2021-01-30T16:16:10+00:00,1,"I ordered 2 pair of the XS children sided socks. They are not good quality. They feel like plastic and the type of socks you get in the dollar bin. But they are novelty socks so I could get over that. The biggest problem was they are huge! They are larger than my, women’s size 9, socks. I sent the company a picture and they said that was the children’s size and I didn’t know how youth sizing worked. They looked like they probably use one size fits all. Would not order from this company again."
PupSocks,2021-01-30T14:14:44+00:00,2,"Image came through quite nicely; however, the fit is not good. (baggy at the front of the leg and very stretched on the heel)."
PupSocks,2021-01-29T15:29:36+00:00,5,"5 stars BUT...with the pandemic the shipping took WAY longer than expected and at one point my package was considered ""lost"".It has since arrived and the product was not just perfect but better than expected. Shipping is out of the companies control I understand that, their customer support is phenomenal and they make a great product."
PupSocks,2021-01-29T12:07:38+00:00,5,"I ordered my amazing socks dec 7th. Got lost but new pair arrived jan 14th-ish. They are great quality and my hubby loves them! Was sad I didn’t get them in time to give him for Christmas, but well worth the wait and not the company’s fault. Will order from them again! Thank you!"
PupSocks,2021-01-29T10:57:20+00:00,5,"The perfect gift for the ""hard to buy for"" guy!  Fun socks are ""in"" and though right now most are still working from home, they still need socks and this pair with our son-in-laws dog put a smile on his face.  Everyone loved seeing Guiness's face on the socks!  Quality picture and material."
PupSocks,2021-01-29T05:30:47+00:00,3,"The fabric of the socks is not comfortable. I received the socks very late when they were suggested to arrive by Christmas. The sizing is hard to determine online. However, the picture of our pet was amazing."
PupSocks,2021-01-29T04:27:45+00:00,2,"The socks are super cute.  Unfortunately, they do not fit at all.  None of us will wear our cute socks because they simply do not fit.  Mine are extremely awkward and uncomfortable; they are large and loose around my feet, and tight on the calves.  Both my 17-year-old and 14-year-old daughters wore their respective socks for about 5 minutes and then took them off and apologetically expressed that they would most likely not wear them again because they didn't like how they fit. Thank you for trying."
PupSocks,2021-01-29T02:44:20+00:00,3,"The products are great.  The socks are nice and the blanket is super soft.  Overall very pleased with the product- if my rating was solely based on the product it would probably be 5 stars.  BUT, the whole experience did not meet my expectations.  Before ordering the site said 15 business days to receive international orders I believe.  The items didn’t even ship out for about a month.  After shipping it took another month to receive the items.  I inquired about the status of the products three to four weeks after ordering and it took about a week or more to get a reply.Overall disappointing experience but the products turned out great."
PupSocks,2021-01-29T02:12:00+00:00,2,"Although the masks we ordered were cute, they were non functional. Unless I take them to a seamstress who can turn them into functioning masks, they are useless. When my kids try to breathe in them the fabric is inhaled through their mouths. They can't breathe in them."
PupSocks,2021-01-28T21:50:07+00:00,1,"received a sloppy order on Dec. 26.  reported the problem (picture of pup is upside down from ALL the words on the blanket) on the same day.  It took until January 11 to get a 4 paragraph email saying how busy they are but how important my business is and that they will get to me eventually.  In the meantime, I got a few opportunities to make a review.  Decided to wait to see how this unfolded- refund? correct product replacement?  Nope- neither.  got an email on January 13 that my order was on the way!  What order???  Turns out, an exact repeat of the first order- no addressing that there was a problem with it the first time.  So today I go online to see my orders, dates, account numbers...and re-report the issue.  And leave a review.  That is when I saw that on their messaging help box, they responded on January 11 to my December 26 inquiries.  Didn't see that until today (bc I haven't been sitting at my computer on their website waiting for 2+ weeks for the response), 1/28.  So, I am unimpressed with this company's ability to communicate and do wise business.  Hoping for a refund at this point bc both wrong blankets have unintendedly become kennel liners. Both are the same sloppy work (every picture upside down from ALL words).  Won't shop here again, but cute idea!"
PupSocks,2021-01-28T20:31:34+00:00,2,3 months to receive my order is way too longToo large (I chose small for a girl it'slike a man large)Doesn't feel like a 30$ pair of socks at all quality wise.
PupSocks,2021-01-28T01:23:25+00:00,4,"They are great! We can see the animals clearly, it's truly a great pair of socks! I am truly happy with my purchase!"
PupSocks,2021-01-27T22:01:04+00:00,5,So cute! These were the perfect gift for my friend! They came out so good!
PupSocks,2021-01-27T19:38:50+00:00,2,I was a bit disappointed in the quality of the sock.  The material is very thin and stiff to the touch.  The quality of the picture was great but actually getting use out of the socks seems unlikely.  It is a good thing the money goes to feed the animals.  Sad the product wasn't nice enough to give as gifts like intended.
PupSocks,2021-01-27T15:13:01+00:00,5,got these for one of my husband's Christmas stocking gift...we all laughed hysterically!  they're a hoot...great for a silly gift...the pictures are exactly what I uploaded!  love them....
PupSocks,2021-01-27T06:24:31+00:00,1,"I placed my order on December 8th, with the expectation it would be here by Christmas. I received notification that it was in production on December 9. I received it in mid January. The blanket I received had an unknown dog on it. It took several tries to get customer service to contact me back. Their options were to get a store credit, or a new blanket. Given the length of time, a complete refund should have been the option. I have been promised a blanket in five days. I’m not holding my breath."
PupSocks,2021-01-26T22:27:22+00:00,5,Outstanding customer service!
PupSocks,2021-01-26T15:28:56+00:00,3,"I truly wasn't expecting just men's socks.  I bought these for my daughter for Christmas and they are huge as I thought they were women's sizes too. I admit this may have been an oversight on my part but this information wasn't clear as far as I could see.  I also want to comment on the significant delay on shipping.  Although I recognize that this may be out of the company's control, timely correspondence (on the status of the order), to let us know would be appreciated."
PupSocks,2021-01-26T09:25:32+00:00,1,Product never arrived.
PupSocks,2021-01-26T02:06:52+00:00,1,"I received the wrong size , they are too big!  Will you send me the size I ordered please ?"
PupSocks,2021-01-25T19:45:24+00:00,3,The pictures on the socks turned out great. Although the socks don’t really fit like normal socks. I bought them as a gift but don’t think they will be worn so that’s too bad. Thanks
PupSocks,2021-01-25T19:23:29+00:00,1,I placed my order in December 3 and I was expecting to give it as a Christmas gift. My socks were shipped December 10 and I haven’t heard about that (today’s January 25). 😞
PupSocks,2021-01-25T18:58:42+00:00,1,"Your customer service is highly unresponsive. I wasn't even able to get my product for Christmas because there were delays. I was provided options to choose from, and when I did, no one responded. I ultimately cancelled the order. Across multiple platforms (instagram, facebook, and email) I attempted to reach customer service and it took an inordinate amount of time to get a response, and the wait time for a response between replies was also unacceptable. I would never recommend this service to a friend."
PupSocks,2021-01-25T18:12:07+00:00,1,The material for more expensive pair of socks (granted they had a special photo) was terrible.  I have never felt such cheap quality.  I will not buy again for the price nor will a recommend to anyone else.
PupSocks,2021-01-25T17:35:31+00:00,4,"My brother-in-law loved his socks! The only reason I didn’t give a 5 is because I ordered it on time to get it by Christmas but, they came in on Christmas Eve and I had already left town to be with my family. They were like a week late from when they should have been here.😔"
PupSocks,2021-01-25T17:28:10+00:00,3,"I mean who wouldn't want a picture of their dog on their socks? I got this as a Christmas gift for my husband and I couldn't wait for him to open it. I was a little disappointed in the fabric, not super soft or sock-like at all. My husband complains a bit about the fit. They are a tad large on him and very tight and bunchy at the ankle. Not the most comfortable, but a super fun sock!"
PupSocks,2021-01-25T15:28:09+00:00,1,Order never received. Can’t reach anyone to discuss. Email response blames USPS. Not getting any replacement merchandise or a refund! DO NOT order from this company.
PupSocks,2021-01-25T09:13:22+00:00,1,Ordered nearly 2 months ago and haven’t received the item.
PupSocks,2021-01-25T04:55:10+00:00,5,We love our socks and the mask we purchased!!
PupSocks,2021-01-25T03:43:13+00:00,5,Great gift idea
PupSocks,2021-01-25T00:39:17+00:00,2,Quality of the photos on the socks was not good. They came out looking very dark
PupSocks,2021-01-24T19:34:31+00:00,5,"Sent an image, wasn't sure if, based on the dog's coloration, the silhouette would work, but they were perfect."
PupSocks,2021-01-24T19:01:55+00:00,1,While the picture idea is cute the value of the socks is terrible. Last time I will buy these.
PupSocks,2021-01-24T18:05:10+00:00,4,"I will say, pup socks has excellent customer service. However do not order these socks for a child. I originally planned on gifting these to my 8 year old niece but their smallest youth size is comparable to a woman’s size 6-8. So really only suitable for adults. But they did offer a refund in the form of store credit and handled the complications with my orders very well."
PupSocks,2021-01-24T16:03:07+00:00,1,I ordered two masks for Christmas and I realized the challenges surrounding 2020 caused delays in shipping. However it took two months to receive my order and half was missing. I only received one mask and have contacted pup socks 2 times asking for an ETA or a refund on my mask that never arrived with no response. There’s no information on when or if the rest of order will arrive. This was a difficult year for everyone and I would expect at least some basic communication regarding my order and to provide a refund if dissatisfied. The mask I did receive didn’t fit my face and had no hose “pinching” wire so I’m also disappointed with the quality as well. Hoping someone from pup socks can eventually respond to me as I’m pretty disappointed I just gave them money with no expectation on delivering their product.
PupSocks,2021-01-24T14:42:02+00:00,5,These socks really were the perfect gift! The image was clear on the socks. Timely delivery too.
PupSocks,2021-01-24T14:25:58+00:00,1,"I paid and never received my order 2 months already...be careful, they will steal your money"
PupSocks,2021-01-23T22:58:52+00:00,5,The socks were lost in the mail and they were happy to replace!  Loved the socks. Will order again.
PupSocks,2021-01-23T20:26:49+00:00,1,"Horrible socks, beware! Not only when ordered early Dec for Xmas, they were delivered the 3rd week of January! If that wasn’t bad enough, then they were HORRIBLE quality, my pets face is unrecognizable and the material feels like plastic. When I asked for my money back they refused. Don’t buy this extremely lame product from an inept company."
PupSocks,2021-01-23T19:33:22+00:00,1,"Ordered socks for a Christmas gift in plenty of time. Got someone elses’s socks 3 days before. Finally asked for a refund mid January snd got a PARTIAL refund. They kept $9. for setting up the order, the order I NEVER got. Still trying to get a FULL refund. I did not order socks to lose money. I paid for them, then end up with NOTHING PLUS I’m out $9.00. Ridiculous."
PupSocks,2021-01-23T18:51:18+00:00,1,"Unfortunately I cannot wrote a positive review of my experience. I ordered 3 items in mid November for Christmas, and they arrived in Mid January. In addition to the ridiculous wait time, when I finally received the blankets I had made for my children, one was of some other person’s dog and not our cats! I have attempted to reach Pupsocks several times to give them an opportunity to make this right, however I have been ignored.With all the choices for customized items out there, choose another provider. The blankets are nice, however it is not worth the hassle."
PupSocks,2021-01-23T16:39:19+00:00,2,"First thing, DO NOT BUY THE SOCKS!! If you can even call them socks. They look nothing like the pictures. The material is...I don’t even know what. They’re huge, they’re like others said, not wearable. So save yourself the trouble. The blanket is a blanket; it’s a cute concept but if you have a dark coloured animal the picture will not work. Looks like a dark blob. It didn’t work at all for me and of course they didn’t communicate with us asking for a new pic or anything.  Be conscious of the pic you’re sending them, edit and lighten it before sending. And as for the shipping, be prepared for a wait, no communication etc. Frustrating. I regret the purchase but the blanket will work sitting around a campfire this spring. 😉"
PupSocks,2021-01-23T13:45:52+00:00,5,My husband loved his socks 💕. Even though they didn’t make it in time for Christmas (shipping issue). Customer care handled the situation perfectly. They responded to my email quickly kept  me updated and resolved the issue efficiently.
PupSocks,2021-01-23T00:05:39+00:00,4,Arrived today & it turned out really cute.
PupSocks,2021-01-22T23:38:50+00:00,1,Terrible experience - take your money elsewhere!!  Ordered socks and a mask for the holidays - two weeks before - received them after the 1st of January.  During the delay sent multiple emails with no response and then when they did respond they were form letters and no offer of discount or refund.  Customer service is HORRENDOUS!!  They will not even respond to their bad reviews as they do not care about their customers!!!!  Stay away!!!
PupSocks,2021-01-22T23:14:09+00:00,4,"Loved the fun idea of a cute puppy picture against a bright and noticeable color! Material is thinner than expected, but still a great gift to give away!"
PupSocks,2021-01-22T20:55:58+00:00,1,I ordered December 6 as a Christmas present. The order confirmation stated 5-10 days delivery. It took over a month and they were the wrong color. I paid $70 for two pair of low quality socks with a blurry image of my granddog.
PupSocks,2021-01-22T17:45:59+00:00,1,"If I could have given this 0 Stars I would. DO NOT purchase from this company. These are the most uncomfortable cardboard socks I have ever felt.  I don't know how you could even call them socks.  The company is doing false advertising knowing they can not make deadlines promising to have their product deliver by Christmas and then when they realize they aren't going to make deadlines they continue to advertise they will make deadlines for the next holiday. The product will come weeks after the fact, even when you purchase a month before their cutoff date.  Worst customer service/ policies I've ever seen. Purchase at your own risk."
PupSocks,2021-01-22T06:09:20+00:00,1,"I placed my order on November 23, 2020 which should have left plenty of time to receive it before Christmas.  It is now January 21,2021 and I have yet to receive the order. Absolutely unacceptable. Won’t be ordering from this company again."
PupSocks,2021-01-22T04:08:07+00:00,5,"Love my masks! It took a little longer than I hoped to ship, but the quality is great."
PupSocks,2021-01-22T03:36:06+00:00,5,These socks made THE BEST Christmas gifts for my sons & daughter-in-laws! Thank you!!
PupSocks,2021-01-22T03:00:09+00:00,5,Picture came out perfectly on the socks!
PupSocks,2021-01-21T22:22:34+00:00,5,Very nice people and great quality socks!
PupSocks,2021-01-21T22:09:18+00:00,1,The socks were cute but were way too wide for my daughter's feet.
PupSocks,2021-01-21T21:52:56+00:00,5,They are just as they were promised! The shipping took a long time though.
PupSocks,2021-01-21T18:58:27+00:00,5,"Ordered this blanket Christmas Day when I saw the one my sister got as a present! Just received it today, one month later.   Considering everything going on.   A month doesn’t seem horrible. But the blanket! Omg I would have waited my whole life for this.  I love it!!! It’s so soft and the pictures are amazing! I had three different dogs and it was only an extra $6 amazing.  Would highly recommended!!!"
PupSocks,2021-01-21T16:26:43+00:00,1,"I ordered an $80 blanket on November 11th and still haven't received it over two months later. It's now January 21st. I got a fake shipping confirmation on December 12th with a USPS shipping label that just says ""USPS awaiting pre-shipment"" when you try to track it.I've emailed the company only to get a form letter back blaming the USPS. This was supposed to be a Christmas present.If you don't have the staff to fulfill your order volume, maybe stop advertising on instagram."
PupSocks,2021-01-21T12:42:37+00:00,5,"Great customer care! USPS lost my package and the Pupsocks team worked with me and communicated very well to help resolve the postal service error (Thank you Courtney!) Not Pupsocks fault at all, but they made Customer care a priority. Order processing and shipment were quick for a customized/personalized product. Print quality was great. The socks looked exactly as rendered on the website. True to size. Overall very satisfied!"
PupSocks,2021-01-21T10:55:50+00:00,1,"It’s been 2 months now and haven’t received anything, I’ve emailed about where my order is and haven’t received a reply...Not very happy can I get an update where my order is."
PupSocks,2021-01-21T09:18:59+00:00,1,"I placed my order 6. December 2020 and it is still in processing, was supposed to be a Christmas gift... Never shopping here again."
PupSocks,2021-01-21T07:36:36Z,1,"I ordered my socks on November 26th and I still have not received them.  When I try to track the package I only get this message: ""A status update is not yet available on your package. It will be available when the shipper provides an update or the package is delivered to USPS. Check back soon.""  It has been like that for over 1 month.  I have contacted the company, and still waiting on a response."
PupSocks,2021-01-21T04:41:23Z,1,"I initially sent my order on November 18, 2020. I ordered 4 pairs of socks. One pair of the socks arrived with the incorrect dog face on it. I emailed customer service and nearly a week later received a reply asking to send a picture of the incorrect pair. I never received a reply after sending the picture so I emailed again. I received a reply from Tyler asking to send another picture of the incorrect socks. I did on December 24 and still haven't heard back from anyone. Do not order from this company because the service is horrible!"
PupSocks,2021-01-21T01:09:08Z,1,"Awful.  We placed our order several weeks before Christmas and our order was promised between Christmas and New Years.  After notifying the company we received THE WRONG ORDER, it took two weeks for someone to follow-up with us.  Poor delivery, poor customer service and a poorly run company.  TAKE YOUR BUSINESS ELSEWHERE."
PupSocks,2021-01-21T00:31:13Z,5,I had socks made for a friend with pictures of her 2 dogs. She loved them. I thought she was going to cry!
PupSocks,2021-01-20T21:12:09Z,2,"I gave 2 stars ONLY because the socks were so cute, and it was fun watching my kids unwrap them on Christmas.  However, there is not much stretch to them.  My kids can’t squeeze them onto their feet, so they are basically worthless.  It’s such a huge disappointment especially because of the cost."
PupSocks,2021-01-20T19:17:02Z,1,"The material that the socks are made off is not nice, kind of uncomfortable."
PupSocks,2021-01-20T18:39:04Z,5,Order received well before I required them. Product delivered perfectly as ordered. Recipients were thrilled with their personalized gifts. Thanks pup socks!
PupSocks,2021-01-20T17:08:01Z,5,Really cute socks.
PupSocks,2021-01-20T17:00:57Z,1,Slow customer service and never got my order.
PupSocks,2021-01-20T13:11:58Z,2,The mask is so cute but can not be worn for its intended purpose. It does not fit where it will stay on your nose and keep the mouth covered when talking. It was a gift to a person who wears a normal size for all the other masks to be worn during covid. Sad that it can’t be worn because it is so cute.
PupSocks,2021-01-20T12:51:31Z,1,"Cropping and print as fine but I was hoping the socks would be usable, like wearable. They aren't even try onable...the material feels like something I've never seen before.Really an awful experience."
PupSocks,2021-01-20T12:05:45Z,1,It has been 2 months since I ordered my product and it still hasn't arrived. It was suppose to be a Christmas gift and we are now almost at the end of January and my order is nowhere to be seen. I am very disappointed.
PupSocks,2021-01-20T11:37:15Z,5,These socks were the highlight of Christmas. My daughter was brought to tears. They’re a great product too.
PupSocks,2021-01-20T05:17:09Z,5,Socks arrived in a timely manner and I enjoyed the job they did in creating these!  Thanks!
PupSocks,2021-01-20T05:13:21Z,2,"The print is not vibrant, but it's cute enough and they did a good job cropping the image. My daughter thought they were uncomfortable, but adorable. Unfortunately, while the youth socks are advertised to fit size 1 - 5, they are slightly too small my size-3-wearing kiddo. Additionally, I'd advise against ordering the optional gift packaging, as I paid for it, but did not receive it. When I reached out to customer service about that, it took just over two weeks to get a reply and the reply was a useless template that in no way related to the detailed email I sent them. The lack of customer service is an absolute deal breaker for me. I will not be ordering from PupSocks again and I cannot recommend them."
PupSocks,2021-01-20T04:17:11Z,1,"I purchased the socks on December 5. Later in the month I received a digital proof. It is January 19tj and I still don’t have my order. The tracking number has been set on preshipment status for over a month. I’ve enquired several times and have only received one response, a form letter. Where are my socks????  You could have made and shipped a dozen by now."
PupSocks,2021-01-20T02:19:21Z,2,"I ordered the large blanket Delivery was pretty good - received before Christmas I left in package and forwarded the gift to my friend in South Carolina.  She loves it...BUT there is a large strip mid blanket - a blank - white strip, where no color and no image was printed.  Is there anything we can do?"
PupSocks,2021-01-20T02:10:42Z,5,Gave these to my daughter for Christmas with her fur babies on them. By far her favorite gift this year
PupSocks,2021-01-20T01:35:40Z,1,Still haven’t received my 4 pairs of socks.
PupSocks,2021-01-19T23:59:09Z,1,"YIKES!!!!! I thought this would be a perfect christmas gift for my boyfriend, until the socks arrived. The print quality of the socks is terrible!!! I requested to have the images be cropped a specific way, which was ignored but rather than communicating with me that this wasn't possible and cancel the order, they mailed me the socks, gave my dog a new ear, and completely disregarded everything I had asked. I emailed customer service to receive a refund and the best they could do is refund it minus $9.00 for a ""customization fee"", even though it was their mistake. Also, it's pretty funny how they ONLY show the 4 & 5 star reviews on their website. I wish I had looked more into this company before placing an order :("
PupSocks,2021-01-19T21:50:20Z,5,Customer Service was stellar. The quality of the product is great and I am so excited to gift these socks! I had had an issue with the mailing address because the order shipped later than expected. PupSocks created a replacement order and shipped it to my correct address. They were communicative and helpful in the process. These socks are a must for any pet lover!
PupSocks,2021-01-19T21:20:46Z,5,Love the blanket that I ordered!!! The picture was replicated perfectly!!!Highly recommend!!!
PupSocks,2021-01-19T21:06:49Z,5,"Our order finally arrived today, and it was well worth the wait!  We ordered the mask and socks, and our dog Blossom looks so cute.  Both are great quality, the mask has adjustable sizing, which is great.  Thank you so much!  The wait between order and delivery was a bit long, but totally understandable, between large Christmas orders and COVID, but loved the mock up email that was sent to tide us over until the order arrived.  I will most definitely order again!"
PupSocks,2021-01-19T18:43:32Z,2,"Nice pattern, pictures were clear, but socks are garbage, uncomfortable and poorly made. I wouldn’t purchase again"
PupSocks,2021-01-19T18:27:45Z,1,"I ordered my socks on December 10th, before the guaranteed Christmas delivery deadline. I JUST received them today, January 19th. Needless to say, my dad missed out on a Christmas gift by a long shot.Finally being able to look at the socks, the quality leaves much to be desired. The knit prevents any real detail in the photos to be shown. The fabric feels cheap, and thin but stiff at the same time? The photo cutouts themselves seem to have been done with the bare minimum attention to detail — the tip of one of the heads is chopped off on every print. If you're submitting, I recommend pre-cutting out the faces you want and submit them on a white background because submitting an unedited photo isn't reliable.I'm really disappointed that I spent almost $30 and waited over a month for these. I'm almost too embarrassed to give them to my dad at this point."
PupSocks,2021-01-19T17:27:13Z,4,My blanket turned out great! It got lots of laughs and it is also amazingly soft and cozy! The only bummer was that it was a Christmas gift and it did not make it in time.
PupSocks,2021-01-19T17:13:48Z,1,"I am so disappointed because everyone LOVED their socks upon seeing them, and the kids were so excited to wear them!!!  The photos of the dogs were perfect!The problem is that these socks are not wearable, and barely even put-on-able!!!  They do not stretch, whatsoever, and there-in liesThe bulk of the problem, as well as the proportion of the foot portion of the sock - that part is cut way too big.I thought my kids were kidding me when they said they couldn’t really even put them on, but then I triedTo put my son’s socks on (Blue Size L Women’s 12+/Mens 10-13) and I practically sprained 2 fingers and broke a nail trying to put them on (I wear a size 9 women’s and he wears a 10.5 mens).   My daughter’s pair (Pink Size M Women’s 9-11/Men’s 7-10) socks were equally difficult for her to put on (she wears an 8.5 women’s)- she got one on, and gave up on the second.  The socks just do not stretch, and seem to be cut super tight in the ankle (cannot even pull them up above their ankles at all, they just staySuper Tight around the ankle).  My kids are slim, FYI, so chubby ankles/calves are not the problem ;-). In addition, on my daughter’sPair, the foot portion (once she was able to wrestle one of them on) was about 1.5” longer than her foot.  She never has issues withSocks that are sized 9-11 women’s.  The proportions and cut/design on the socks just seem to be way off.  Super tight in the ankles andExtra long/roomy/wide in the foot -  and the fabric has almost no stretch, which doesn’t really work for socks. Fabric quality feels and looks super cheap as well.  Very disappointed in this purchase and the fact that the company does not respond, just one auto reply 3 weeks ago despite several attempts to reach.  Not cool.  Would advise against purchasing their socks."
PupSocks,2021-01-19T16:19:23Z,1,Terrible Service and Extremely Unhappy. I have reached out to your team now 4 times in regards to a refund for my product. It took 2 months to ship to me and when it was finally out for delivery it was stated that the incorrect address was on the package and returned back to your facility. I am not waiting 4 months to receive this product and would like this issue dealt with immediately.
PupSocks,2021-01-19T15:50:00Z,2,"I got 2 pair as gifts and the recipients say they are cute but they don’t wear them because they’re uncomfortable, poor quality, and they bunch up. My mom said it feels like they’re not formed right and the material is cheap. Got the right sizes for them. Don’t waste the money- it’s a lot to spend on socks that aren’t being worn. Just get a mug with the pet face on it. Super bummed"
PupSocks,2021-01-19T15:26:49Z,1,"This is awkward but very disappointed with my socks. They are the most uncomfortable socks I've ever worn. I wear a size 9 so I ordered the medium but they are too big. There is so much extra material around the toes it bunches up and is very uncomfortable with my shoes on. Having said that, there is absolutely no give in this material. So while there is a lot of extra material, the area around my ankles is really tight. And no I do not have large ankles. Maybe this is because the socks were made in China. Of course they were printed here, but the socks were made in China. Finally, I ordered 2 pair (one as a gift) and they did not arrive until Dec. 26th. So, I have to mail my gift-another expensive. The actual picture of my dogs does look nice though."
PupSocks,2021-01-19T07:15:49Z,1,"Shocking service and poor quality product.Ordered early December after seeing an ad stating “order now for delivery for Christmas”. They could not fulfil this, and when chased via email, took ages to respond. Ordered on 14th Dec and product arrived 7th Jan!!!Not only that, when I’ve seen the product, I wish I hadn’t bothered. The photos are great however the socks are dreadful. One long bit of tubing, not sock shaped, poorly fitting and doesn’t stay in place. Emailed again to explain I’m not happy with the product and nothing! Avoid! You’ll get more pleasure burning your money"
PupSocks,2021-01-19T04:14:17Z,4,"The photo on the sock was perfect! We got a notice it was being sent to the USPS and it took 3 weeks to get there.  After that it shipped quick.  Not sure if this is a holiday or Covid issue or their norm. It did not arrive in time for Christmas and I ordered in November, but was enjoyed for New Years."
PupSocks,2021-01-19T04:06:57Z,1,"Ordered blue socks with my son’s cat on them and received pink socks with a lab-doodle face. When I contacted the company, they offered a store credit! Christmas has passed and I don’t want a replacement pair. I actually don’t want any kind of reminder of this crappy product and company. No response when I pushed for a refund"
PupSocks,2021-01-19T02:32:04Z,1,The socks don't fit my eleven year old son's foot. They are too tight. I ordered the appropriate size too.
PupSocks,2021-01-19T01:16:49Z,5,Very cute! The gift reciever loved it and I ended up ordering more.
PupSocks,2021-01-18T20:18:17Z,5,The blanket turned out amazing.
PupSocks,2021-01-18T20:11:08Z,1,"SAVE YOUR MONEY and DO NOT ORDER from this company.I purchased 6 pairs of socks from PupSocks for Christmas stocking stuffers and was not completely satisfied with my order.  I placed an honest 3 star review and the company replied with a ""resolution email"" Offering a half decent resolution, to send a blanket at no charge, however once I replied to that email  I have not heard a word from ""Ren of the PupSocks team"". I have followed up with 3 separate emails and still nothing. I can't locate a phone number at all for the company.  So Please, just save your hard earned money and order from somewhere else to avoid the disappointment. ***Past Review and reply for your referenceNeeds Improvement!The image of your pet on the socks is great, perfect. I was disappointed with the quality of the socks themselves. The socks need improvement. There is no heel in the sock, and when wear the socks they bunch at the top of your foot. The socks are made of one long piece of material, where as regular socks are made with a slight angle, which help with the fit.Reply from PupSocksDec. 3, 2020Hi there,Thank you for sharing your feedback with us.

PupSocks,2021-01-18T19:26:25Z,1,I ordered socks on 12/7 and have not yet received them. A shipping label was generated on 12/11 but was never shipped. I reached out to customer service and got an automated reply on 1/1/21.  I reached out again with no response. And I was charged for the order already.
PupSocks,2021-01-18T18:01:35Z,1,I ordered the socks in November and still have not received them... Its January... just hoping I will receive the right socks at this point.
PupSocks,2021-01-18T17:48:53Z,1,"If I could give zero stars I would.  I ordered a pair for Christmas (ordered November 18th) and they sent the totally wrong socks.  After trying to email them and having the message returned I finally got in touch with them on December 7th.  They apologized and said they would reprint and send.  Didn't send until the day before Christmas and arrived several days after.  I sort of understood that.  HOWEVER, THEY JUST REPRINTED THE WRONG SOCKS!!  Absolutely horrible customer service and product."
PupSocks,2021-01-18T16:45:06Z,1,I haven't received my order and I bought it more than a month ago.
PupSocks,2021-01-18T16:11:17Z,1,Cheapest product I’ve ever seen. I ordered 12/5 and didn’t receive it until 1/12 and it was the wrong size. The customer service was horrible. I am so glad they were so late and I had to buy another gift for this child because these would have embarrassed me they are so cheap looking.
PupSocks,2021-01-18T15:31:02Z,5,Socks arrived very quickly and in time for Christmas. They came out great!
PupSocks,2021-01-18T13:44:56Z,5,"Although they went through 5 weeks of traveling through North America over December 9 - January 16, thanks to the post office, my daughter finally got them this weekend. She LOVES Them!"
PupSocks,2021-01-18T13:28:33Z,2,Very disappointed.  Ordered long before Christmas and did not receive until after Christmas. The ear pieces on the masks are not adjustable and are way too big. Can not wear them.
PupSocks,2021-01-18T00:09:36Z,1,Order was wrong. I contacted and two weeks between responses. Promised to make it right and still haven’t received corrected order. Will never use them again!!
PupSocks,2021-01-18T00:02:28Z,3,The socks were great but it took 2 months for delivery.  We ordered them in November hoping to give them as Christmas gifts but they arrived well into January.
PupSocks,2021-01-17T23:56:36Z,1,"I'll start with the good: The print of my cat's face was nice.The bad: If these socks would be a year, they'd be 2020. But hey, garbage year so I might as well walk into next year in garbage socks! Speaking of garbage, these socks are definitely made out of it, because there is not a Single. Natural. Fiber. In them. The shape at the toes is so wide I think they were designed for a mutant duck-footed humanoid. Let's not even get into how uncomfortable they are due to some embarrassing amount of bunching due to it's poor design and construction...I had red marks on my feet from wearing them for 5 minutes! WHO DESIGNED THESE?!0/5 stars for the biggest fail of the year, guys I really think you gotta switch up yo' biz'. No hard feelings, but these socks will be framed and put on my wall, cause I ain't wearin' em. (I would want my money back but I'm too lazy, so here's my ""angry"" review doused in humour to lighten the mood.)p.s. DON'T BUY THESE."
PupSocks,2021-01-17T23:40:44Z,1,"These socks are unwearable. They are basically a straight tube, there is a barely-there hell gusset but it's not enough for a real, human heel. This results in excess fabric bunched on top of the foot. The toe is also a square rather than rounded meaning, you guessed it, more excess fabric. With lots of pulling you might get a quick photo op in these socks but the poor fit and excess fabric means it will never fit inside a shoe and they're totally useless. Absolutely would not recommend. We wasted money on not one but TWO pairs, what a rip."
PupSocks,2021-01-17T22:43:30Z,1,Sock fit is terrible with next to no elasticity and lots of extra material on either side of toes.
PupSocks,2021-01-17T18:17:02Z,3,"I ordered the socks with two faces, one of our cat and one of our dog.  They did a great job of printing their faces from the photos I sent. I was so excited to give this Christmas gift to my husband.I'm only giving a 3 star rating as the socks are shaped like tube socks therefore bunching where the front of the foot bends making them uncomfortable to wear.  Unfortunately my husband doesn't wear them because of that.  I can say the XL size did fit my husbands size 12/13 foot.  Shipping took much longer than expected - about a month, but in Covid times everything takes forever to get shipped out."
PupSocks,2021-01-17T18:12:09Z,5,"Everything is great, customer service, as well as the socks with my girlfriends dog on them! I am from Europe and it took 2 months for the order to arrive, feels a bit slow, but I guess it doesn't depend on them"
PupSocks,2021-01-17T17:43:30Z,2,The picture on the socks was pretty good quality but the socks were not shaped like normal socks. They did not fit right and were not made right. My sister will never wear them as socks. This product is not worth buying because they are not functional.
PupSocks,2021-01-17T17:02:58Z,4,The socks are great and fit comfortably. I took a star off because one pair is still lost in transit but I think that is actually the postal service's fault.
PupSocks,2021-01-17T15:59:28Z,3,"The socks look amazing!  The graphics are exactly what was advertised.  They were a huge hit as a gift.  But... the material used does not make for a fully comfortable sock.  It is understandable that a specific material is needed to be printed on, but was hoping for something a little bit better."
PupSocks,2021-01-17T14:09:33Z,5,Got the pup socks as a gift and my friend LOVED them! Fantastic gift for those with fur children!
PupSocks,2021-01-17T03:36:19Z,1,"Placed my order on 11/27 and as of 1/16 still no product. I’ve emailed three time and received the exact same generic response about being so busy and at mercy of USPS.  Tracking says usps created a label on 12/7 but ‘waiting on item’, PupSocks has yet to prove my order was sent to USPS and the tracking number is worthless. 7+ wks and counting.Update, my order was delivered on 2/2/21-obviously the first order was never processed."
PupSocks,2021-01-17T02:38:25Z,1,"Still waiting to hear back. It's been weeks since I received the wrong (and late) order. Haven't heard back from the company about a refund. The socks are horrible quality made from thin plastic like material, overly large not really designed for a normal human foot, and by the looks of other people's experiences the wrong product regularly arrives. Don't waste your money, extremely disappointing company in both product and service."
PupSocks,2021-01-17T02:20:47Z,1,Made a purchase weeks before Xmas and STILL not received...
PupSocks,2021-01-17T01:01:01Z,5,Fantastic gift idea. Loved them when they came and so did the recipients.
PupSocks,2021-01-16T23:28:35Z,5,Great job on the socks. Artwork on the photo couldn't have turned out better. Only problem was that I thought it was THE perfect gift. Turns out it was because my daughter in law bought my son a pair as well. The good news is that he was thrilled to have TWO pairs. Great company!  MORE than satisfied!!
PupSocks,2021-01-16T22:48:34Z,5,Ordered a customized mask with my pup on it and it’s amazing. So amazing I’m ordering another one now.
PupSocks,2021-01-16T20:25:08Z,1,"Took 6 weeks to get the socks. Once received, quickly noticed the strange material and shape of the socks. They are extremely wide and not shaped to fit a human foot. We will never wear these. Don’t waste your money."
PupSocks,2021-01-16T19:35:56Z,5,"Very clever, well produced masks! These made great gifts for pet lovers in our family!"
PupSocks,2021-01-16T18:57:09Z,1,"Took TWO months to receive socks. Poor quality fabric, and they are so WIDE...! Socks shouldn’t be tight nor constrictive but those are ridiculously too big. A complete waste of money. Don’t bother. Couldn’t give less than a star."
PupSocks,2021-01-16T17:35:24Z,5,"I ordered a blanket for my son as a Christmas gift, and due to the mail situation he just received it. It’s beautiful and he loves it. Super soft and cozy. These make adorable gifts for pet lovers. Will order again."
PupSocks,2021-01-16T16:23:40Z,1,"Poor customer service. Received the wrong product with the wrong photo. I have reached out to customer service, but have not heard anything in weeks."
PupSocks,2021-01-16T15:24:33Z,1,"I am giving a 1 star review because I ordered pup socks on Dec 4, 2020 and have not received my order.   I am frustrated I trusted the company to fulfill an order and am now out money that was set aside for Christmas presents."
PupSocks,2021-01-16T14:39:31Z,1,Order took almost 7 weeks and when it finally showed up it was completely wrong ! I received socks with a generic german Shepard on it not the face of our cat i submitted ..  very disappointed Hopefully getting a refund
PupSocks,2021-01-16T10:23:37Z,1,"It's been more than a month since I've made my order, and still no sign of it. I get that the delay might be due to shipping and covid and whatever, but as a company you can't tell me my order is going to arrive by Christmas and then show no trace of it for another month (and who knows how much longer!). It's unprofessional, it would've been comprehensible if the problems were specified in the first place, but not doing so is anything less than dishonest."
PupSocks,2021-01-16T06:03:58Z,1,"TERRIBLE SERVICE!! I paid extra for rush delivery but my order did not arrive until 34 days later. On top of that, I received a notice from USPS that I had to come in and pay MORE shipping to receive my item. After finally receiving the item I realized the socks were unusually slim and poorly made. No phone # to contact the company by phone. I only received an auto-response to the email I sent in. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY!!!"
PupSocks,2021-01-16T02:43:22Z,3,"I ordered socks with a photo of my cat’s face and they turned out exactly as I had pictured from the website. However, the socks were smaller than expected (purchased size based on the size chart provided - I would recommend sizing up!) and the material did not allow for very much stretch so unfortunately they don’t fit. I purchased them mostly as a novelty item than for wear anyway so overall I’m happy with my purchase."
PupSocks,2021-01-16T02:26:52Z,1,"The picture of my dog turned out great, but the material is terrible!! It is sooo uncomfortable. It also bunches near the ankle, which is painful. Will never actually wear these, don’t waste your money!"
PupSocks,2021-01-16T01:26:18Z,1,Ordered almost 2 months ago and still hasn't arrived in mid January... would never buy again
PupSocks,2021-01-15T22:32:09Z,2,"The cropping of my pets heads was not as well executed as I would have expected, given that I did provide detailed instruction. Also, the detailed mock-up (only shared to me following my order being completed) showed the bones and paw prints, but these were not previously visible when selecting the colour, etc."
PupSocks,2021-01-15T21:57:57Z,1,"Ordered the socks for Christmas, and there even was a line on the website saying the if you ordered at that time, you'd receive the socks before Christmas (it was beginning of December).Got the socks today (mid January).Quality of the socks is terrible, but prints looks ok.One sock has a hole in it with fabric coming out of it where they are tied together. Not even worn once, it already has a hole in it.Terrible experience, would not recommend, especially for $25 a pair.Go somewhere else, I'll try my best to advise against this company to everyone I know."
PupSocks,2021-01-15T20:54:00Z,1,Terrible experience! The mask I bought is a terrible design that is too small for anyone over the age of 10 and I wrote to the company within the time-frame for returns. No response until almost a month later! They want me to take a store credit! Ridiculous! Don't make the mistake I did!
PupSocks,2021-01-15T20:11:32Z,5,The socks I ordered turned out to perfect. The recipient was thrilled.
PupSocks,2021-01-15T19:30:32Z,4,"It took a long time for the socks to arrive...far too long...BUT the company is commended for keeping in touch with me through email, and keeping me informed. In many cases, this delay for the arrival is due to the carriers who deliver the product and not the company itself. I very much so complement the company on sending a mock-up of my socks, so that it still gave something for me to put under the tree for its intended recipient (to show them what they would be receiving). The socks arrived yesterday finally, and I don't love the material of the socks (personal preference thing), but they did look how I thought they would look, and how it showed on my screen when I ordered, and when they sent m the mock-up. Overall, I'm still pleased as a customer, and the company can be forgiven as we are in unprecedented times with COVID deeply effecting our physical and emotional environments."
PupSocks,2021-01-15T19:18:10Z,3,"Socks were cute. We were disappointed that the picture printed did not account for the fact my cat was a long haired pet and had a “mane.” This was cut out for in the picture on the socks and the picture of his head did not seem centered in the cookie cutter  cat shape they used for the printing. Our bigger concern is I ordered one pair of socks and now have received 5 pairs in several different shipments. So, as far as the socks- probably okay if you have a short haired cat but maybe not for long hairs."
PupSocks,2021-01-15T17:57:25Z,4,"Socks look great, quality of the actual socks is extremely poor."
PupSocks,2021-01-15T17:41:37Z,5,Unfortunately shipping was super slow and these didn't make the Xmas stockings
PupSocks,2021-01-15T17:18:41Z,1,I ordered these as a gift for Christmas and they were not at all what I expected to receive. The picture I sent in was not what was printed on the socks. I emailed the company about the issue and still have yet to hear back from them. I will never buy from them again.
PupSocks,2021-01-15T16:33:07Z,5,"loved the socks, as did the recipient!"
PupSocks,2021-01-15T16:05:46Z,2,"This turned out to be a disappointment.  The mask we ordered was of poor quality - it did not effectively cover our daughter's face, nor was it good quality filter material.  Our daughter found the socks to be uncomfortable.  All this was a big surprise.  Our daughter ADORES our dog, and we thought these would be a fantastic gift.  She was pleased - she found the concept ""amusing"" - but doesn't use the socks nor the mask.Additionally, the product took a LOOOONG time to arrive.  It was intended as a gift for early December and we ordered about two weeks in advance.  But it took I think over a month to arrive.  In very short time we got a notice that it was ""in production"" but it stayed in that status for weeks.All that said, the product does what it says, and the image of our dog was clear and well cropped - which is why I give this 2 stars instead of 1."
PupSocks,2021-01-15T13:19:53Z,1,"Placed an order in early November. The next week I got my order. They used the wrong background. I reached out and was assured they’d redo the socks at no charge. It was still mid November so plenty of time before Christmas. It’s now Jan 15 and still nothing. My order number still shows to be “in production” on the website. When I reached out via email and Facebook messenger to request a refund, they used an automated response which means I will likely never heard from anyone."
PupSocks,2021-01-15T13:15:02Z,1,How can I review a product I never received?  After 2 months and no idea if I’ll ever receive a 32.00 pair of socks I’m frustrated
PupSocks,2021-01-15T02:50:17Z,1,"I was really excited when placing my order at the very beginning of December. While I understand shipping times are insane, my product still hasn’t arrived, tracking is useless, and no actual person is responding to my emails. I am now out over $70 and without a product. Due to this disappointing experience I unfortunately would not recommend ordering from pup socks."
PupSocks,2021-01-15T02:21:49Z,1,Terrible customer service. I tried to call but no number. Sent email and they replied once but no confirmation on my refund
PupSocks,2021-01-15T02:16:44Z,1,I have not received my order yet. Still waiting as it is extremely late.
PupSocks,2021-01-15T01:23:22Z,1,Very bad customer serviceOrdered my socks over a month ago and the tracking information given to me still has not been updated. Merchant has put the responsibility on me to find out where the package is.Terrible experience. Go somewhere else.
PupSocks,2021-01-15T00:29:46Z,4,"The socks are nice, though a little big at the toes."
PupSocks,2021-01-15T00:21:10Z,1,The socks have another dogs photo.  I sent an email to return but didn’t get a response.  Very disappointed!
PupSocks,2021-01-14T23:30:12Z,5,"I got these socks for Christmas gifts and my grandson and grown really got a kick out of these. One had his dogs on socks, and the other Catan they both really got  kick out of them. Nice surprise."
PupSocks,2021-01-14T23:20:02Z,2,"Terribly slow communication.  Socks arrived in a good amount of time, but arrived damaged (there was a big snag).  I immediately emailed customer service as well as sent a message through FB messenger.  I received a response some weeks later and now are waiting again on a response to my last correspondence to them.  I won't ever use this company again."
PupSocks,2021-01-14T23:02:08Z,1,"I would like to rate them a BIG 0 but that isn’t an option. Not only did it take forever to receive the mask I ordered for my adult son. They sent the complete wrong mask and the dog pic on the mask wasn’t my sons.  Their email responses are computer generated and they don’t respond to requests for refunds. When they finally do, they offer a store credit!!  Don’t waste your time!  Can probably order the same thing from your local Walgreens. Oh and BTW, their face masks are infant size!!  Horrible customer service and clearly no business experience!!"
PupSocks,2021-01-14T21:14:19Z,3,"The material is very weird, not like any socks I have felt before. Plus they are shaped flat, so the socks crease weird on top of the foot. The images of the dogs came out well."
PupSocks,2021-01-14T20:49:52Z,1,"After 5 weeks of waiting (Christmas time was crazy, I can understand), I get the wrong order. Right socks, but wrong pet. Who got my cats ? I have your dog !!"
PupSocks,2021-01-14T20:49:26Z,2,I ordered a second pup sock set in a new order on December 13th and still don’t have the socks. They’ve been “in transit”since 12/21.  My first order arrived in a couple weeks. I know you have no control over the postal service but I’m thinking you might want to reconsider shipping options.
PupSocks,2021-01-14T20:36:42Z,5,The socks were a perfect cropped picture of my dog. They are made of very nice material!
PupSocks,2021-01-14T19:42:42Z,5,"I was so excited to find a custom option to include both of my cats on one blanket. Submitting my photo choices was very easy and the turnaround time was faster than I anticipated for a custom item. I’m very happy with the final product. My babies look so adorable together on the white background that I chose. The images are exactly as depicted in both of my pictures, which is amazing to see on a blanket. The fabric is incredibly soft, lightweight while still providing warmth, and is large enough to share with my husband (ordered the biggest option). We love how cozy it is. Definitely recommend!"
PupSocks,2021-01-14T18:27:20Z,3,"Finally received our order.  Quality is great, pictures are excellent quality.  Only disappointment is I ordered lime green (daughters favourite colour) and the blanket is green.  The mock-up we were sent was lime green.  If I knew I was getting green not lime green I would have ordered purple."
PupSocks,2021-01-14T16:20:32Z,1,"Order placed 2020/11/27, still did not received."
PupSocks,2021-01-14T15:44:45Z,1,Ordered this product Nov 30 and it still has not arrived- Jan 14. Not thrilled as this was a Christmas gift.
PupSocks,2021-01-14T15:33:07Z,3,"I was waiting 5 weeks for my delivery. Carrier USPS told me because of COVID and higher volume during Christmas and so on. I ordered end of November and it was promised to receive it before Christmas for sure and I finally got it Jan 13. It also says no Chinese Fabrication but sticker says Made in China. Anyway, maybe different carrier to use in future, USPS does not have best service, especially for international freight like mine to Canada. It was disappointing."
PupSocks,2021-01-14T14:36:03Z,5,The socks were a gift. They came out beautifully and the receiver was so pleased at the quality and the photo printing.
PupSocks,2021-01-14T14:26:44Z,3,"I finally got the blanket and socks I got for my boyfriend for christmas, the material is awesome and the quality of it all is awesome! I placed the order back in November so it wouldn't have been late but I just received it on Monday. Unfortunately something happened with the shipping and I did get an email and did receive 25% refund which was great and really nice of pupsocks!"
PupSocks,2021-01-14T14:10:50Z,4,"I received my order yesterday and it is exactly what I expected - a little better actually! Photos of our kitties turned out super clear on the socks and our pup blanket is adorable. Very happy with the product and it makes for a really cute, personal gift!!I placed my order Dec 2nd and based on the description in the ad on facebook, I understood that it would arrive before Christmas (these were Christmas gifts). I am in Canada so despite what ads said, knew that there could be delays. Not getting them by Christmas was disappointing, but understandable with covid restrictions in place.Customer Service at Pupsocks replied within a couple of days to my inquiries about the status of my order, and even sent a mockup of my socks & blanket to give as a gift Christmas day. I was very happy with this.It took a little over a month to receive my order, but it was worth the wait.I would give my experience a 5 star review, but docked a star as I wish their facebook ads were more transparent in the time production takes and delivery. I think promising quick delivery in ads is misleading. After reading other reviews online I was nervous that I wouldn't receive my order at all, and I am really happy to be able to give Pupsocks this positive review!"
PupSocks,2021-01-14T13:04:47Z,1,"I ordered 2 pairs of very expensive socks on November 30,2020 as a Christmas present for my son..... it’s now January 14,2021 and they have still not been delivered!!!!!!! This company is a joke.  They took my money real quick though."
PupSocks,2021-01-14T08:06:26Z,5,PUPSOCKS MADE IT TO AUSTRALIA!Although they did not arrive in time for Christmas (I'm in Australia) I was pleased to know that I was kept up to date via email of the progress of my order and they arrived when you said they should. As they were a gift I cant talk about quality etc yet but the recipient was pleased with the image.
PupSocks,2021-01-14T05:17:57Z,3,The socks were cute and the photo quality is nice but the socks are ill fitting and uncomfortable.
PupSocks,2021-01-14T03:04:30Z,1,Still no response from a Christmas order places in Nov. Have written to 3 different emails for customer service. All returned.
PupSocks,2021-01-14T02:10:06Z,1,"Very late delivery, bad quality socks. Will never order again from you"
PupSocks,2021-01-14T00:46:45Z,5,The blanket I ordered for my grand pup was adorable! Made it just in time for Christmas. She wrapped herself all up in her blanket and made me smile 😃
PupSocks,2021-01-13T23:49:45Z,5,Absolutely loved it!!! Got it as a gift for my mom and it was amazing! Blanket is super warm and nice and fuzzy.
PupSocks,2021-01-13T23:12:22Z,1,I didn't receive my order and no one has respond to me about my missing order.
PupSocks,2021-01-13T22:53:19Z,5,My daughter loved her socks.  Got her one pair with her cat on them and other pair with the two dogs.  She was so thrilled with the socks.
PupSocks,2021-01-13T22:46:16Z,1,My order arrived almost 2 months after I ordered it. It was a Christmas gift so I had to buy a different gift because I knew they weren’t going to arrive on time. The quality was poor when I did receive them. I couldn’t get ahold of anyone to get any information. I finally got an email 3 months later  responding to the complaints I made about the delivery. It said they would not issue any refund or partial refund because the item arrived ON TIME!!! It was way past the 10-12 days as advertised. Extremely disappointed! The email had grammar and spelling mistakes which makes me think it wasn’t made in the U.S
PupSocks,2021-01-13T21:35:41Z,4,"Overall, I am happy with everything. The quality of the socks and blanket I got are nice. Some things that would've made it better: Better communication as to when they would be done. Shipping took forever as well, but I guess that isn't their issue, although I feel like if it had gone into production earlier, shipping would've been quicker (I think it took about 10 business days for them to start order). No proofs! I think you should definitely receive a proof of what the product will look like before they just make it for you. The texture and quality of the blanket are great. I feel like the photo could be a little better. Overall, I am happy."
PupSocks,2021-01-13T21:19:53Z,2,the two star rating is mostly regarding how long it took for the product to get to me.. .nearly two months since date of purchase/order. The quality isn't the greatest however it is good and the receiver of the gift was very happy and loved them!
PupSocks,2021-01-13T20:56:44Z,1,Unfortunately my order arrived late which I understand due to Covid but when it did arrive it was someone else’s pet on the socks . I have emailed twice no response or refund
PupSocks,2021-01-13T20:49:52Z,5,Great product!  Exactly what we hoped for.  We ordered several pairs of socks and two blankets.  All came out great!
PupSocks,2021-01-13T20:26:41Z,2,"In general, I love the mask, but I can't wear it. The plastic things that help adjust the ear straps were not on the straps, but loose in the bag.  I tried putting them on, but I haven't been able to push the straps through the tiny holes.  I even tried using a needle to push it through,  It didn't help.  Maybe there is a simple fix and I am overlooking it, but It would have been nice to be able to use right away.  Please let me know if there is an easy way to do this."
PupSocks,2021-01-13T20:07:11Z,1,I ordered these for my son in November and they were shipped Dec 9th....I still have not received them. I emailed Pupsocks and got a long winded explanation about have delivery driver issues but no offer to send out another pair or refund my money. Very disappointed
PupSocks,2021-01-13T20:02:30Z,1,Haven’t received my order yet - last tracking update was Dec 17
PupSocks,2021-01-13T19:45:26Z,1,"I ordered from Pup Socks on November 28th and thought it would arrive in time for Christmas. Received a notification it was shipped on December 7th, tried tracking via the website they provided; website had a loading error for at least 3 days. When I was finally able to upload the tracking number on the site all it says was shipping info was received on the 8th. It's been like that for over a month. I have tried PupSocks numerous times via email and phone with no response. I personally think it was a Facebook scam and am truly disappointed this Christmas gift for my son did not materialize and I am out money."
PupSocks,2021-01-13T19:44:48Z,3,"The sock fabric is weird and plastic-y, more of a novelty than usable socks. Image cropping was fine."
PupSocks,2021-01-13T19:11:32Z,1,Items came after the Holidays - disappointing considered I ordered Dec 1st.Socks are cheap/ course fabric and will most likely NEVER be worn by the family members.  Blankets - 2 were as delivered.  One (red) - color / dye has white lines through it in places - just poorly made.  The 4th I ordered - not as I thougth it would come - meaning the photos were strictly the heads of family members meshed together.  Looks OK - just not what we thought it would be.We wish we could recommend the product but can't. The customer service for status is non-existent and the product delivery pitiful.  Much would have to change before we would order again - too bad!
PupSocks,2021-01-13T18:36:14Z,1,Bad! ordered socks for christmas on December 2.Never got them and it's January 13th.On top of the pacifying emails promising fast shipment are empty promises.Do you really think I want a credit from this company. 440 dollars out the window.Desepointing
PupSocks,2021-01-13T18:17:56Z,1,I placed an order on 12/12/20. Did not receive until ~1/4/21.  I also did not receive the right sizes per my order.  My family found the sock material and fit very uncomfortable.  I requested a refund given multiple issues.  I was told I could only get a credit for the wrong sized socks but would still have to pay $9 each for customization!  Really!?  Absurd.
PupSocks,2021-01-13T18:15:42Z,2,"It took a long time to receive my order, but I did get it in time for Christmas! The three pairs of socks do not fit well at all and one pair has a snag in them. I sent a message to the corporate office and have yet to hear anything from them. Very disappointed! They are not inexpensive socks...I expected a much better fitting sock for the price.I will not be purchasing again unless they actually call me and help to resolve the issues...."
PupSocks,2021-01-13T17:59:28Z,1,"This Christmas item was never received.  I tried following up with customer service -- twice -- with no response, what so ever.  I think this company if fake!"
PupSocks,2021-01-13T17:56:48Z,1,"You cut off the feet around the dog's face in the pic! That was the WHOLE point of using that pic. And now, the way you cropped the pic, it looks absolutely ridiculous. I even messaged you specifically about NOT cropping the feet out, as that was the reason for using that pic. So disappointed..."
PupSocks,2021-01-13T17:48:51Z,5,The socks were perfect and the faces of the animals were also perfect.
PupSocks,2021-01-13T17:40:49Z,4,"I ordered two pairs of socks as Christmas presents. That was on November 30.Today is January 13 and I still haven't received them.USPS says they were accepted on December 19. And apparently that's where they still are.edit: got them, and they seem like they're good quality"
PupSocks,2021-01-13T17:40:44Z,1,"Horrible experience with my order. When I first saw the advertisement I thought it was an awesome idea, especially as my wife and kids love our dog and my wife is big on wearing socks that stand out. I figured what better Christmas gift then a sock with our loved dog and kids. The order was submitted in Novemeber with four images where my wife and three kids were holding our dog close to their face. I submitted the order asking if it can be done in that manner and got no response. I received my first order and the image of my daughter and dog were left off. I submitted a claim online to receive a corrections and guess what happened, this time they sent a pair of just images of my dog. So now I have two pairs that are wrong. At this point I'm asking for a refund and i'm being told their company policy is to issue store credit to which I say no thank you. I'm not ordering from them again and can't seem to get my $45 and change refunded to my original payment method. I've been exchanging emails with them for days and nothing."
PupSocks,2021-01-13T16:57:20Z,2,"Pretty miserable experience overall, unfortunately. I ordered a Christmas gift on Dec. 02, and did not receive my order until Jan. 11Pup Socks didn’t even start making the order until after Christmas, despite promising it would be ready in time for the big day. The order then got lost in shipping, with no expected delivery date in site. Pup Sucks ignored my email to customer service as well, making this a pointless experience overall. Do not promise delivery dates you have no hope of being able to fulfill. The only reason this isn’t a 1 star review, is because the actual product was satisfactory. Will not be ordering again."
PupSocks,2021-01-13T16:51:42Z,5,Perfect reproduction of my puppy Roscoe. The.blanket is soft. Will definitely order again
PupSocks,2021-01-13T16:51:38Z,5,It was so easy to upload a picture and they did a fantastic job! I highly recommend them
PupSocks,2021-01-13T16:40:58Z,1,"Arrived super late.Don’t particularly like the material they are made from, neither did the person I bought these for."
PupSocks,2021-01-13T16:22:18Z,5,Women's sock was great.Men's sock was too small.
PupSocks,2021-01-13T16:19:44Z,1,"Disappointed. I submitted a photo and they cut my daughters face out with her cat Marcy. Marcy's face is small on the socks, and not a full face because I wanted the entire photo. So disappointing."
PupSocks,2021-01-13T15:47:16Z,1,I never received my order and sent 2 customer service emails via the website and never heard back
PupSocks,2021-01-13T15:32:26Z,1,"Ordered my socks on 02 Dec and recieved them 09 Jan. I'm pretty sure it was the USPS's fault seeing that the order was sent out 18 Dec. However, when I did receive the sox the material that was used for the sox would be better used as a headband or elbow brace. This material is definitely not for footwear. This was a gift for our daughter. Hopefully she'll think the 32.00 socks as a nice thought rather than a quality product her mother and I would endorse."
PupSocks,2021-01-13T15:31:10Z,1,"I still have not received the gift I ordered in early December,  I can't get tracking and I can't get PupSocks to respond."
PupSocks,2021-01-13T15:26:34Z,4,The recipients of the socks I sent as gifts loved them.The only thing I wish that the company would offer is the ability to send a message or card with the socks. I was sending them directly to friends as Christmas gifts and they had no idea where they came from.
PupSocks,2021-01-13T15:18:19Z,5,PupSocks created very cute socks per the image I sent.
PupSocks,2021-01-13T15:02:30Z,3,Delivery missed the Christmas target.  Product was good
PupSocks,2021-01-13T15:01:45Z,1,I still did not receive the package that was ordered on December 1st... they were supposed to be Christmas gifts and the tracking number that was given to me still says ups still has not picked the package up from you all
PupSocks,2021-01-13T14:58:30Z,5,"We ordered a blanket and socks and I cannot tell you how impressed we were with the quality and the pictures! Actually I can, we ordered 2 more blankets as gifts. You want to give the ultimate unique gift definitely order from pup socks!"
PupSocks,2021-01-13T14:54:17Z,4,The socks and masks are very cute and good quality.  However there is no phone # at all to contact the seller and you can only communicate via email.  When I did communicate via email they were responsive but a bit vague.  Items were order 12/1 and arrive 1/5.  Website had said it would take 14 days to produce then ship.   I gave them 4 stars because I like the product but wish they arrive  sooner for Xmas as planned
PupSocks,2021-01-13T14:43:06Z,1,I haven’t received my pup socks yet 😢Ok I just received my socks and they are cute but the material is not stretchy. So the part of your upper foot does not stretch at all and therefore is soooo tight on both my teens.
PupSocks,2021-01-13T14:34:00Z,5,"Although they didn’t make it in time for Christmas (not pupsocks fault), they are so cute and the colours are so clear! Can’t wait to wear mine and get them to the proud new dog owner!"
PupSocks,2021-01-13T14:26:26Z,2,I ordered this blanket as a Christmas gift on December 1st with shipping to Canada.  A few minutes after ordering it I realized the picture I sent was maybe to dark so I wrote to ask if I could change it. Took until December 4 to even get a response and then the customer service department cancelled my order and reordered it with the new picture on December 4. Wrote several times to check on the status of the blanket as it was a Christmas gift and as Christmas got closer I was worried. Took days and days to even get a response again. Was checking multiple times a day and status said in production for a good 2 weeks. The blanket finally arrived. YESTERDAY. January 12. Absolutely ridiculous wait time for what was supposed to be a Christmas present. Blanket is very nice but the fact that it arrived almost 3 weeks after Christmas (not to mention 6 weeks after I ordered it) was crazy and disappointing. You should definitely reconsider who you use for shipping. I would not recommend ordering to Canada if you need it within a two month period.
PupSocks,2021-01-13T14:22:31Z,3,Love the finished product of the socks - super cute! They however took a month and a half to get to me even though when I ordered them the website had indicated they would arrive in time for Christmas.
PupSocks,2021-01-13T14:14:16Z,1,I ordered a custom sock that was supposed to have two different faces of my cat on it. When it came in the mail it was only one face and not my cat at all. I have tried several times to reach out to PupSocks to correct this or get a refund and have yet to hear back.
PupSocks,2021-01-13T13:55:47Z,1,It had been over a month and I still have not received my pupsocks. I ordered some as Christmas gifts and I was really excited about it but I haven’t received anything and now I’m getting emails to review the product.. I will be asking for a refund.
PupSocks,2021-01-13T13:55:01Z,1,Socks arrived with multiple snags in the fabric.. emails remain unanswered. Absolutely horrible experience.  These were a Christmas gift and my daughter was extremely let down. Do not do business with this company. Poor quality and even worse customer service.
PupSocks,2021-01-13T13:52:45Z,2,Great novelty item but not great socks. There is no shape to the socks and the material is not comfy.
PupSocks,2021-01-13T13:42:17Z,1,"I ordered socks for my son for Christmas on November 30th, and I still haven’t received them. I received an email right before Christmas with a mock-up of my order to give to show what he would be receiving. I have heard nothing from the company since then. ( except wanting me to leave a review 😏)...  I sent an email regarding my order, and almost immediately received an “generic”email that I’m sure everyone who has been waiting on their order has been getting. This is my second purchase from pup socks. My first order was great, no problems at all.  I probably won’t order from them again."
PupSocks,2021-01-13T13:37:37Z,3,"they're cute, a gift for my mom, but they aren't nice comfortable socks. she will likely never wear them, so i do regret my purchase overall.. they are a strange material."
PupSocks,2021-01-13T13:23:49Z,1,I ORDERED PUP SOCKS FROM YOUR COMPANY...WHEN I RECEIVED MY PACKAGE USPS THE PACKAGE WAS EMPTY...THERE WERE NO SOCKS IN PACKAGE.  I BROUGHT IT TO THE MAILMANS ATTENTION HE MADE A NOTE THAT PACKAGE WAS DAMAGED TO USPS I REACHED OUT TO YOUR COMPANY BUT NEVER GOT A RESPONSE. SO I BASICALLY WASTED MY MONEY & DIDN'T GET MY SOCKS I BOUGHT FOR MY HUSBAND FOR CHRISTMAS.
PupSocks,2021-01-13T13:11:13Z,1,"I placed my order, in no particular hurry to receive it, knowing the World and USPS is lagging. I received a package from Pupsocks 1 month later. The wrong color, with a picture of a pet that isn't mine. I tried contacting the company to let them know. No way to speak to anyone on the phone. ALL messages, emails, etc. Were automated and really did not address my questions or comments. I would not recommend this company to anyone!"
PupSocks,2021-01-13T10:49:42Z,5,They were so cute and comfortable. Picture was great.
PupSocks,2021-01-13T09:02:27Z,5,Best gift ever!
PupSocks,2021-01-13T08:25:32Z,3,"If it was a review based purely on the products I received, this would be a 4 or 5 star review - they're great. The reason for the 3 stars is due to the massive delay in receiving them. And here's the thing: I only needed to know a truthful estimation of the date to expect. I ordered them around Dec 2nd and the estimator was showing I'd receive them around the week of Christmas. I felt it was a bit optimistic given it was the holiday season (not to mention a raging pandemic) but I took it at face value. I didn't receive the package until Jan 9th. I would have still provided a 4/5 star review if that was communicated to me upfront (and yes, I still would have purchased them as well). I'll still probably purchase products in the future."
PupSocks,2021-01-13T08:00:14Z,1,Took over a month to receive my order and it was only one pair of sock when my order was for two with two different prints
PupSocks,2021-01-13T06:44:26Z,1,I ordered the socks two months ago and still haven’t received them.
PupSocks,2021-01-13T06:41:29Z,1,"I bought the child socks and they are absolutely humongous, like Christmas stocking humongous. I waited over a month for them to arrive and my daughter can't even wear them. The images of our dog are very clear but the actual socks are garbage. Do not buy!"
PupSocks,2021-01-13T06:16:14Z,1,"I ordered these sock way before Christmas. I still have not received them as of January 13th. I ordered these socks with my sons dog on it. Since I ordered them his dog had to leave.  He is mourning the loss and now I cannot give them to him. I wish I could of given him the socks before his dog left. Now it was a waste of money and I still do not have them.  It will be too hard for my son to see them at this time,  if they would have came when I ordered them 2  o this ago it would have been perfect timing. I am so disappointed with the service."
PupSocks,2021-01-13T05:48:54Z,4,Very nice! Just a little on the pricey side.
PupSocks,2021-01-13T05:37:12Z,1,Bad quality of material. Not worth the price.
PupSocks,2021-01-13T05:04:18Z,5,"The pictures look the same, the socks are good quality, it's a little pricey for what it is but it's worth it for the exceptional and funny gift :)"
PupSocks,2021-01-13T04:11:26Z,1,"I ordered my custom blanket for a Christmas gift on December 4, 2020 after seeing the adorable pet blankets on Instagram. I was so excited to surprise my fiancé with the blanket on Christmas, but it didn’t show up on time. I understood it was covid/Christmas and usps was having tons of delays, but as of January 13, 2021 it has still not showed up. I have tried to call cx, but there’s no number. This is absurd to not keep your customers in the loop even if they’re long delays, and there should be a number to call to find out what the status of my pending order. IT’S BEEN OVER A MONTH."
PupSocks,2021-01-13T03:51:11Z,4,"My order was incorrect. I sent two different pictures, for two pair of socks. When I received my order, my two pair of socks were of the same dog.   I have sent three emails, without a reply"
PupSocks,2021-01-13T03:49:59Z,1,Ordered on 12/18/20 and paid for shipping to have this by Christmas. It’s now 1/12/21 and they still aren’t here.
PupSocks,2021-01-13T03:17:07Z,2,Ordered Nov 25 and did not receive my product till after Christmas. I ordered early to make sure I would receive it. It was a gift. Didn’t arrive in time.
PupSocks,2021-01-13T03:16:19Z,4,"The material is a little odd. Otherwise, they are very cute."
PupSocks,2021-01-13T02:59:56Z,5,Absolutely adorable!  I’m so happy I decided to purchase them as a gift and she loved them!!!  Thank you!
PupSocks,2021-01-13T02:51:08Z,5,I sent a small cropped picture of my friends dog to put on a mask. I was very pleased with the mask and the quick turn around . My friend absolutely loved it . She told me it was the best present she ever got.
PupSocks,2021-01-13T02:38:04Z,4,"The pictures are great but the socks are not very comfortable especially for kids , I would definitely buy more if the socks were more plush and there were options to pick from for kids, like ankle or long socks and options on the comfy ness- thanks Melanie"
PupSocks,2021-01-13T02:35:59Z,1,These socks are ugly as heck. They look good on the website photo but when you get them.... OMG 🤮!! There is NO shape to the sock the sizes are huge compared to what they should be. There is no taper to the sock it is literally a box shape. Pure crap
PupSocks,2021-01-13T02:31:34Z,1,"The socks product quality is terrible, it is really just a gimmick to have a cute pet picture printed on useless socks.  The order process was quick but delivery took over 30 days!  Expensive product and not worth the costs, they will never be worn, I would not recommend nor order again"
PupSocks,2021-01-13T02:25:01Z,1,I ordered some socks in early December as a Christmas present.  It’s now Jan 12th and they have still not arrived.
PupSocks,2021-01-13T02:21:40Z,1,"These socks are terrible. The material is not a material you'd ever want to wear, and they are cut as a straight tube, ZERO foot/ankle fit. So the material bunches up on top of your ankle, the end of the socks hang way past your baby toes cause there is NO SHAPE. Poor construction, weird material - would not recommend."
PupSocks,2021-01-13T02:16:14Z,5,The socks with my brother's dog are great! He was so happy!
PupSocks,2021-01-13T02:05:25Z,1,"The socks did eventually arrive and wow...I was blown away by how little they actually resembled the shape of a sock. It looks like these socks were made by someone that has never seen a foot and has no idea what the general shape of a foot or human leg is. They are too wide at the toe and would only fit above the ankle if a person had no calves. The shape makes no sense, the size is way off from what the guide suggests, and the material is so poor that I would not wish my worst enemy to have to wear something so plastic-y/scratchy. The product was just as disappointing as the service. They were ordered at the end of November, were supposedly shipped early December, and then never arrived. After inquiring, I eventually got a message saying that they must have been lost and that they'd send another pair. This seems to be a commonly used message based on other reviews/social media and while I'm sure some packages get lost, this seems out of the ordinary. When I responded saying that seen as it was already 2 weeks after Christmas, I'd rather just have a refund, I received no response. I rarely ever write reviews and when I do, I usually try to do positive ones, but this pair of socks takes the cake on the worst online purchase made in a very long time...maybe ever. The only redemption was the good laugh about how terrible the socks are with the person I bought them as a gift for. Great product IDEA. Terrible execution. Negative One Billion Stars."
PupSocks,2021-01-13T01:58:21Z,1,"I ordered my pair of Pup Socks on Black Friday, 2020, and if took 6 WEEKS to arrive to its destination. When I found out that it did not arrive by week 3 (no email confirmation saying it shipped, etc.) that’s when it said “Due to holidays, shipping will be delayed.” My socks should have arrived before all the holiday craziness. When I tried to reach out about the status of my order (email was only provided; no number), I kept receiving the same email just signed by a different representative. Communication is non-existent. I will not recommend PupSocks to anyone, nor will I order from them again."
PupSocks,2021-01-13T01:57:03Z,3,Almost took a month to receive them.
PupSocks,2021-01-13T01:52:30Z,1,"I received the wrong socks with the wrong dog.  Clearly, I received someone else’s order.  I have contacted customer service via email twice with no response other than an automated response indicating that they are busy.  I understand mistakes happen but disappointed in the lack of response."
PupSocks,2021-01-13T01:42:54Z,5,I loved my pop socks and they looked exactly like my Labradoodle Layla!!!
PupSocks,2021-01-13T01:33:18Z,3,I gave a 3 star review because:1. The material of the socks was not something I found to be comfortable or even flexible.2. Sizing was wide and overly big.*The picture of each dog was super cute and welldone. The product took a long time to get BUT that was by NO means the company’s fault.  These are definitely different times and this company got the socks successfully delivered.
PupSocks,2021-01-13T01:26:01Z,5,"My Pupsocks are awesome, great quality and amazing job on the imagine.  The customer service team did a good job keeping me posted on delay due to holiday shopping. The shipping to Canada took 4 weeks but with the holiday season and Covid keeping couriers busy....just so happy they have arrived."
PupSocks,2021-01-13T01:16:43Z,1,"I placed an order on Dec 1, 2020 for a Christmas.  I still have NOT received my order or any updates on it.  Order #2469787Very disappointed and will NOT recommend!"
PupSocks,2021-01-13T01:01:21Z,2,"The print of the dog was excellent, however the socks themselves were  not even shaped with a heel and were just completely flat."
PupSocks,2021-01-13T01:00:26Z,1,I NEVER GOT MY BLANKET AND STILL HAVE NOT HEARD BACK FROM CUSTOMER SERVICE
PupSocks,2021-01-13T00:47:18Z,5,I bought the socks for my daughter & her boyfriend. They loved their kitties faces on the socks. Great job!
PupSocks,2021-01-13T00:45:11Z,5,Love the socks! My daughter was surprised to see her pup on the socks. Thanks!
PupSocks,2021-01-13T00:22:14Z,4,"The socks overall seem like a cheap quality. Pictures are good, one picture of our black cat was very dark and hard to see. The biggest problem was it took a month to get here. Missed Christmas by 2 weeks, not the companies fault but still annoying."
PupSocks,2021-01-13T00:19:24Z,5,This socks were shipped fast despite it being right before Christmas and they were so stinking cute!!!!!!!!  Ordering was simple and there were no surprises when the product was delivered.
PupSocks,2021-01-13T00:13:29Z,2,Order came very late. Quality of blanket and socks are sub-par. Socks do not fit correctly and are very poorly made. Blanket looks worn already. Would not order from here again.
PupSocks,2021-01-13T00:07:18Z,2,"I want to say I had a good experience with Pupsocks, but I did not. I ordered a pair of socks on December 2, 2020 hoping to give them away at Christmas, but they got lost or stolen in the shipping process. When I made inquiries about my order online, no one responded to me despite the site saying that I would get a response within 72 hours. It wasn’t until early January 2021 that a sales representative directly contacted me to say they were starting my order from scratch. When I finally did receive my socks (6 weeks late) I was sad to see that the quality of the photos on my socks were poor and flat. I would not recommend anyone spend their hard earned money on these socks."
PupSocks,2021-01-12T23:54:05Z,5,Product turned out great! Ordered Dec. 1st Arrived just before Christmas..
PupSocks,2021-01-12T23:38:04Z,5,"My pupsocks got hung up longer than I expected in the mail due to the online shopping rush of Christmas 2020, but the socks arrived on the 24th like a Christmas miracle and totally made Christmas. Great quality of sock and print."
PupSocks,2021-01-12T23:34:33Z,1,Instead of receiving our dog on the sock we received a ginger cat. Socks also seem to be pretty poor quality and not as they appear on the website!
PupSocks,2021-01-12T23:32:11Z,3,Overall effect is quite good. Managed to surprise the girlfriend with the face of our 2 cats on socks! Minus 1 star for the 1 month shopping delay. Minus 1 star for the design shape of the socks and no crew size.
PupSocks,2021-01-12T23:23:56Z,1,"January 12, 2021. I placed an order December 1, 2020. Received a shipment notification on December 17, 2020. Tracking hasn't been updated and I still haven't received my purchase. I have tried multiple times to contact the company to no avail. I left two message through their help desk on the website (January 5 and 7, 2021). I sent an email on January 7, 2021. There is no phone number listed for the company so I am out of options to get this resolved. PupSocks if you are reading this I would like my order, or a full refund. To the general public, be cautious."
PupSocks,2021-01-12T23:20:52Z,1,It’s been almost two months and order still not received.  No response from the company.
PupSocks,2021-01-12T23:19:37Z,1,"I ordered multiple pairs of socks in November for Christmas gifts. I was told 8-10 days for delivery, but they didn’t show up until a week into January. There was zero communication or offers to make this right. Also, the quality of the socks themselves stink. The picture quality is nice but the sock material is very strange, and they’re not shaped right so they’re tight on the heel and weirdly wrinkled at the front of the ankle, and wide around toes. Pretty expensive waste of money on a poor product, poor delivery, and poor service."
PupSocks,2021-01-12T23:14:46Z,1,I have not received my socks yet! More than a month!
PupSocks,2021-01-12T23:09:30Z,5,"I ordered these socks for a Christmas present for my mom. I sent in a blurry picture of her dog, not expecting much, but I received them in the mail and they are AMAZING! I give this company 5 starts."
PupSocks,2021-01-12T23:08:00Z,2,I ordered these almost two months ago and still have not received them.
PupSocks,2021-01-12T23:07:35Z,5,"They came late because of the postal backup, but my Grandchildren enjoyed them"
PupSocks,2021-01-12T23:00:30Z,2,"The picture on the socks was cute, but the socks themselves are strange and not something my daughter is likely to actually wear."
PupSocks,2021-01-12T22:55:33Z,1,"Ordered back in November, they state they shipped, still no order and it’s almost 2 months later. If you email- they will reply a week or two later, if at all. they are not very helpful and just blame the post office. Do not recommend unless you like giving this company money and getting nothing in return. No replacement sent out or even offering to find package. Worst customer service."
PupSocks,2021-01-12T22:51:33Z,1,Ordered 2 pair of socks with the same picture for each pair and by mistake I got one pair with a picture that isn’t mine. Wrote a message on messenger and never heard back from them. Very dissappointed.
PupSocks,2021-01-12T22:48:48Z,1,"Saw this ad on Instagram and really thought this would be a good purchase, and not a poor experience.  I purchased 2 pairs of socks for $43 Canadian, and I intended these to be a gift gift for brother and his new fiancée for Christmas.   Shipping took 51 days to reach Canada; received well after Christmas, though I was expecting shipping delays because of the pandemic.  When I inquired further, I received a generic form email saying their shipper UPS wasn’t communicating with them. Tracking was updated very infrequently.On the order customization request line for the graphic artist, I requested that the bow tie on one cat head be included; there was no indication from them that this would not be included until I received their mass email saying the order won’t ship on time with a socks photo included in a printable Christmas card to send to the recipient.I can even accept all of the above, but sock quality is not what I expected.  The sock has an interesting fabric and feel with a glossy look.  They don’t appear to have a very (or a barely) fitted heel.  I don’t think this sock will be worn by my recipients.  Very sorry to say that these are, at best, worth half the price."
PupSocks,2021-01-12T22:42:26Z,1,"I've paid around 1st December 2019 still hasnt arrived. I have a tracking number which says ""item information received"" on the 9th December and no other updates. I have tried messaging via Facebook.... no reply. Really disappointed as it was ment to be an xmas gift. Now to fight PayPal for my money back."
PupSocks,2021-01-12T22:27:24Z,4,very cute socks and I was surprised by the quality of the picture on the socks!
PupSocks,2021-01-12T22:21:32Z,2,"i made a note regarding the picture and what to print, and it was ignored. not a big deal as i ordered dec 9th and holidays and covid complicated things im sure, but i was not happy with the quality and size. the smallest size was still too large"
PupSocks,2021-01-12T22:12:25Z,5,Socks were put together fairly quickly and very cute. :) I love the option to add a note as far as what the image will look like on the socks. Packaged very well also. This was my first time ordering from this company and it was a great experience. Thanks so much!
PupSocks,2021-01-12T22:10:42Z,1,"I know it’s Christmas and I know we have COVID but they advertised they would be able to meet the dates. Not only did they not get it to me on time, half the order is missing and it’s been impossible to get a response from them. Don’t commit to what you can’t deliver and be more responsive. Christmas wasn’t a surprise and neither were the shipping issues. They should have staffed correctly and adjusted shipping times."
PupSocks,2021-01-12T22:00:42Z,2,Felt like my package was lost for months.. I ordered it in november and its still not here.
PupSocks,2021-01-12T22:00:05Z,1,"I ordered my product on Black Friday and have still not received it - on January 12th! You have claimed that it is the fault of the USPS, but I have received products from various other companies through the USPS in a timely manner. I am starting to wonder if your company is even real, or if this is a scam. I would know better, but your customer service takes weeks to reply... and the last reply blamed this on the postal service. Yeesh. Would NEVER buy from you again."
PupSocks,2021-01-12T21:54:28Z,1,"Well, we ordered them on November 30, looks like it was shipped December 30 and now its January 12 and we still haven't received our order.  I guess it went from a Christmas gift to a Valentines Day present"
PupSocks,2021-01-12T21:41:08Z,5,Although there were some issues with shipping do to the overwhelming amount of online orders this year the product is very nice and a cool personalized gift. Helpful friendly staff who ensured the best customer service possible
PupSocks,2021-01-12T21:40:02Z,3,"The end result was decent but it really took a lot of work to get there.  Order placed on 12/1/2020. I didn't receive it til 12/28/2020.  I received ship notification on 12/10 but in fact, the socks had not shipped.  They tried to blame USPS but that was bogus.  Emails to customer service went unanswered.  The socks are cute but not nice enough to order from Pupsocks again.  Thank you."
PupSocks,2021-01-12T21:39:45Z,5,Both items were wonderful!! See you again soon!
PupSocks,2021-01-12T21:37:03Z,4,the blanket i got for my brother was great super soft and he loves it the socks though are funny but not too practical to wear i think but overall a great xmas gift!
PupSocks,2021-01-12T21:35:05Z,2,Quality of socks are poor.    Disappointed
PupSocks,2021-01-12T21:31:48Z,1,My socks were ordered on Nov 30th as a Christmas present. Today is Jan 12th and they still have not arrived.
PupSocks,2021-01-12T21:30:08Z,3,"The first 2 pair of Pupsocks I purchased on line worked out well.  The next order I was trying to order 2 different dog faces on one pair of socks.  I tried 3 or 4  times without success.  I asked for chat help and did not get any useful instructions.  I then asked for an email response and did not get an answer, but I did get advertisement. I also tried to contact via phone and got no where. I gave up and did not order the product I wanted."
PupSocks,2021-01-12T21:29:47Z,5,My daughter LOVES her blanket. the blanket is a quality material and has held up beautifully even after countless washes. So happy with this purchase :)
PupSocks,2021-01-12T21:27:54Z,5,We love our Pupsocks! They were my girls favorite  gift for Christmas.
PupSocks,2021-01-12T21:26:34Z,1,"Ordered back in November as a Christmas present.  Was told it would be around two weeks.  It's now the middle of January and the order hasn't arrived, the tracking details given have no update since the middle of December, and three emails to their customer service team have so far gone unanswered.  I'd say horrible customer service, but as far as I can tell they don't have any.Save yourself the hassle and don't order.  I'm giving then a few more days then going through my credit card company to hopefully at least recover my money.Annoyed and very disappointed,"
PupSocks,2021-01-12T21:08:01Z,1,"I was excited to purchase masks with our pet on them.  However, I was disappointed when I received them - they are small and flimsy - not at all what I had expected.  What made the experience worse, was that I placed my order on 11/30/20 and it arrived on 12/28/20.  I received an email on 12/17/20 saying that it was ready to be shipped and that they couldn't control when the USPS would delivered it.  Of course that couldn't be controlled when they sent it to me so close to Christmas!  The fact that I placed my order in enough time and it still arrived three days after Christmas was mind-blowing.  Overall I am very disappointed and will need to think twice before ordering anything else from this website in the future."
PupSocks,2021-01-12T21:06:31Z,1,Have not received my item that was ordered dec 1.  No responses to my emails inquiring about my order.
PupSocks,2021-01-12T21:05:45Z,2,Christmas gifts that were ordered in November never made it before Christmas. Of course there is no phone # to actually talk to a person and they did not respond to my emails!! Product was as expected but very frustrated with customer service!!!!
PupSocks,2021-01-12T21:01:09Z,1,Are you kidding me? I still don't have my package from Dec 1 and you guys keep sending me a form message every time I email.
PupSocks,2021-01-12T20:57:22Z,5,My granddaughter loved them!
PupSocks,2021-01-12T20:55:58Z,3,"The shipment was very delayed. I understand that shippers were busy but my order didn’t leave your factory until weeks after it was ordered yet you were still advertising 2 day shipping. The socks are very cute, picture turned out well but the fabric is weird and not very comfortable."
PupSocks,2021-01-12T20:50:14Z,5,"My husband is very challenging when it comes gifts. I ordered a pair of socks with our two pups - unique, cute, unexpected for him. While the product is great, what I appreciated most was the customer service. The order was not shipped in time and needed adjustment - BUT the company was responsive and accomodating. My order re-shipped quickly. When it arrived, it did not disappoint! I will definitely order again."
PupSocks,2021-01-12T20:43:28Z,5,LOVE IT!!! The blanket is awesome....clear detailed picture of my pup on a great quality blanket. Thank you so much!
PupSocks,2021-01-12T20:41:13Z,1,I wasn’t satisfied at all with the socks. They didn’t look like my dogs at all and the quality of the socks was terrible. Such a waste of money
PupSocks,2021-01-12T20:40:03Z,1,Read my review on your review portal.  Your service is a joke
PupSocks,2021-01-12T20:37:51Z,1,"First of all there was problems with delivery, so even though I ordered them at the end of November, i didn't receive them until jan 11th, well after Christmas! They are not ""normal"" socks. They are a silkier material. Very weird. I ordered a pair for myself too. The fit is also poor. Baggy on the foot causing gapping and bunching around the ankle. Definitely not comfortable and not socks you would wear regularly.  (I am an avg size female with a size 7.5-8 shoe size). The printing and the face of the dogs came out well, but with all said, not worth the purchase. I will not be purchasing from this company again."
PupSocks,2021-01-12T20:34:37Z,5,Captured photo of our beloved pet perfectly. Comfortable & fun sock attire!
PupSocks,2021-01-12T20:30:36Z,1,"Six weeks after placing my order, I still do not have it.  Christmas is long over.  And now I’m being asked to review a product that I have not yet received.  So I would say that at this moment, I’m not thrilled with the product."
PupSocks,2021-01-12T20:30:09Z,5,My family loved these! Was impressed by the print quality of the pics.
PupSocks,2021-01-12T20:28:20Z,1,"The product took over a month to be delivered.  I understand a few extra days due to holiday demand, but I wasn't expecting that much of a delay.  I asked customer support about the status of my package two times, and I only ever received a generic automated response in return.  On top of that, the online package tracker said the product was delivered when it wasn't; it actually arrived two days later.  The product is great, but the whole process makes me question if I would order from here again."
PupSocks,2021-01-12T20:27:50Z,1,"Never received product, had to open a PayPal claim"
PupSocks,2021-01-12T20:26:26Z,5,Excellent service. Great editing of 2 dogs’ heads from pictures sent. Granddaughter LOVED her socks! Another told me to get them for her birthday.
PupSocks,2021-01-12T20:25:34Z,2,"I was very excited for this gift for my son for Christmas, he loves our dog and he loves fun socks, so I figured this would be perfect! I placed my order the last week of November - 1 pair of socks and one face mask, and it said the order would arrive before Christmas. Well, we did not receive the order until just before New Years, and the socks are a strange material. My son hasn’t even opened the socks from the packaging yet. The print job looks great, but the material is not very soft. The wait was disappointing, as well as the material. Live and learn I guess."
PupSocks,2021-01-12T20:15:37Z,2,"Sadly, I had to dispute the charges after two generic responses and then a non-response to my questions. My package never arrived after showing shipped 12/17. No movement on tracking since 12/19. I understand shipping issues, but being in the parts industry, we would never leave a customer to linger without a resolution within a certain time frame. Very sad how this was handled and that I won't be getting the cute present I ordered."
PupSocks,2021-01-12T20:13:58Z,3,The socks are what I expected but the note I made about keeping the dog's mohawk/hair tuft was overlooked.
PupSocks,2021-01-12T20:01:29Z,1,"Placed an order on Dec 13th. Was guaranteed delivery before Christmas. Order did not arrive till after Jan 1st. Order was missing an item. Attempted to contact the company via email, the only option they give and have only received generic email reply stating high volume of emails. Have filed a complaint with the BBB."
PupSocks,2021-01-12T20:00:29Z,1,We ordered a medium and the foot length was very long.  It also bunched up at the top side of the ankle a lot so was uncomfortable.  Loved my dogs picture though!
PupSocks,2021-01-12T19:59:41Z,2,"I ordered a face mask with my dog on it for my partner. The mask is super small, does not stretch, and moves considerably when you talk or move your mouth in anyway (exposing your nose).  Not really wearable. Very disappointing."
PupSocks,2021-01-12T19:40:22Z,5,Ordered as a holiday gift. Came in looking perfect!
PupSocks,2021-01-12T19:33:47Z,5,"High quality, fun socks!"
PupSocks,2021-01-12T19:32:16Z,5,The socks came and were perfect. I like the thicker material and my kitty’s face came out PERFECTLY! He’s so handsome and the socks are sweet.
PupSocks,2021-01-12T19:19:29Z,1,"Simply put, my order took over a month to arrive and half of it was incorrect. When I contacted them via email, I received a generic automated response which was of zero help. Stay away!⚠️"
PupSocks,2021-01-12T19:15:39Z,1,My order never arrived.  Very disappointed.
PupSocks,2021-01-12T19:11:51Z,5,My son and his girlfriend loved them.
PupSocks,2021-01-12T19:11:24Z,3,"Cute reproduction of pet's face on socks, but poor quality.  Entirely too stretched out/ loose to be worn."
PupSocks,2021-01-12T19:09:09Z,5,I ordered 2 pairs of socks and they came out great! They look exactly like the pups!
PupSocks,2021-01-12T19:04:26Z,1,Quality isn’t great. Communication isn’t great. Shipping time isn’t great. I wouldn’t recommend.
PupSocks,2021-01-12T19:02:23Z,3,"The picture on the socks turned out nice but it took over a month to receive the socks and, even though I ordered in November, my friend didn’t receive the socks until after Christmas 😔"
PupSocks,2021-01-12T18:59:42Z,4,The socks aren’t the color I expected them to be.
PupSocks,2021-01-12T18:49:29Z,2,"Placed order for Christmas on December 1.  Sent first email inquiring about order December 17th.  Sent second email (after getting no reply to the first) and finally received a stock reply on December 29, AFTER the holiday.  Order arrived JANUARY 7th.  I received an email asking about my experience January 8th.No offer of shipping reimbursement, future coupon...nothing to ensure repeat business.I will be sure to share my experience with as many as I can to dissuade them from ordering from this company."
PupSocks,2021-01-12T18:46:54Z,5,"Bought these for gifts and they were a hit! The pictures came out clear , I had 2 pictures on each . The person I gifted them to said they were very comfortable!"
PupSocks,2021-01-12T18:46:12Z,1,I haven’t even received it yet and I ordered early December..
PupSocks,2021-01-12T18:45:23Z,5,Very satisfied with how the socks turned out and they came very fast.
PupSocks,2021-01-12T18:42:22Z,1,"Hello. It took a month for us to receive our package after it was scheduled for 5-7 days. That was disappointing. Also, there is no phone number that I can find to contact costume service. I had a few questions and the email contact I have isn’t returning my emails."
PupSocks,2021-01-12T18:39:19Z,1,Never received my product after 2 months. This is a scam! Horrible customer service
PupSocks,2021-01-12T18:38:14Z,1,I cannot reach anyone at this business. I keep getting emails and I log in to my account...but I am unable to connect with anyone. The email comes back undeliverable. I still have no received the socks I ordered Dec 1st. I think I have been scammed. 😞
PupSocks,2021-01-12T18:33:17Z,2,"While I was very excited to get the socks that I ordered for my kids, upon delivery which, by no fault of your own, didn’t show up until a week and a half after Christmas, I was very disappointed in the sizing. I ordered kids sizes XS/S for feet 1-5 and these socks literally fit my feet and I am a size 9 shoe. So needless to say, my kids are swimming in them. The quality of sock is not great but the sock design and picture of our deceased dog looks good. The image capture of Crosby is very good. I went with you because you advertise “kid sizing”. I feel like I could have gotten better sock quality and having my kids grow into the socks if I had used Pop your Pup. I am honestly not too sure I would personally recommend this site to anyone. While the capture image of Crosby was adorable, the quality and sizing, in my opinion, could be better."
PupSocks,2021-01-12T18:28:17Z,1,"I ordered these on December 1 for my wife for Christmas.  It is currently January 12th, and they still have not arrived.  I don't know if I got scammed or if the shipping should really take this long..."
PupSocks,2021-01-12T18:26:48Z,1,"misprinted a pair of socks that I purchased as a Christmas present for my partner and then refused to give me a refund, and instead offered to give me store credit. I realize this is their company policy, so I wasn't terribly upset but when I took them up on their offer to reprint my socks (even though by that point it would be way past christmas) they then stopped replying to my emails all together. now I'm down $30 bucks and stuck with misprinted socks. DO NOT purchase ANYTHING from this vendor."
PupSocks,2021-01-12T18:25:50Z,2,I never received my order so I cannot comment on the quality of their work
PupSocks,2021-01-12T18:23:47Z,1,I purchased my product on December 1st and it arrived over one month later. Poor quality face mask and socks. Poor customer service. Don’t recommend them at all.
PupSocks,2021-01-12T18:21:01Z,5,My girlfriend loves her socks!
PupSocks,2021-01-12T18:19:50Z,1,terrible quality. unusual sock shape
PupSocks,2021-01-12T18:18:00Z,5,I bought these for my mom as a Christmas gift and she LOVES them. They were her favorite present she got all year.
PupSocks,2021-01-12T18:17:40Z,4,"Reliable gift for Dog Lovers and Animal Faced Sock Enthusiasts; thoughtful, yet simple."
PupSocks,2021-01-12T18:12:52Z,3,"The socks are great but they didn't arrive until 2.5 weeks after they were promised. They took 27 days to arrive when I was quoted 7-10 days including production and shipping. They were a holiday gift and arrived well after the holiday...very embarrassing for me, because the person I gifted them to was left with nothing for the holiday."
PupSocks,2021-01-12T18:12:14Z,4,"I ordered one pair of pupsocks and one face mask with the same photo of our dog's face for my husband for Christmas on the Black Friday promotion.  The socks and face mask are adorable! We are very happy with them!  The socks wash and dry well.  The only negative comments I have are that the order took an inordinately long time to arrive.  Even considering mail related delays due to COVID, the socks and mask took 3-4 weeks to arrive after i placed the order.  The only other slightly negative comment involves the plastic slider on the face mask for it to be adjusted to fit the wearer was not on the mask ear loops when it arrived, and was a little difficult to put on ourselves.  Otherwise, we love the product and have referred family members to this site to order their own pupsocks!"
PupSocks,2021-01-12T18:08:11Z,2,"Sorry but I cannot give this higher than a two. The socks are cute but I ordered them in December 2nd and they didn’t arrive until January 9th. These were Christmas presents. I checked status for several weeks and it only showed that a label was put on them on Dec12th. Knowing all of the issues with shipping this holiday season I just wrote it off as USPS issues. But once January hit and I still didn’t have my socks I reached out to the postal service (1/6). They told me that the socks and tracking # was not in their system yet so they couldn’t do anything and I should contact the shipper (Pupsocks). On Jan 7th, I called in to pupsocks and waited on hold for 20 minutes and called it quits.  And then miraculously they showed up on the 11th. There are way too many competitors to choose from and get items delivered at a reasonable time. Sorry pupsocks - I won’t be returning"
PupSocks,2021-01-12T18:08:10Z,1,"Ordered 11/30 - have not received my shipment, all emails go unreturned.  In addition - they keep sending marketing emails and asking me to review my purchase - that has not even shipped!"
PupSocks,2021-01-12T18:03:34Z,1,"Emailed them twice to let them know I hadn’t received my pupsocks, the response was a generated email saying they are iInundated with emails and would get to my issue as soon as possible. Still no word and it’s been just under a month."
PupSocks,2021-01-12T17:59:04Z,1,Never received item but was charged. Could not reach anyone. They have no telephone or address. Email is only option. They took three weeks to respond. It was too late. Had to dispute the charges on my credit card. I will never use them again.
PupSocks,2021-01-12T17:55:59Z,2,"I am displeased with the product I received from pupsocks. After being served an ad for cat blankets and being unable to source this option from the website to order. I left instructions under the custom notes section requesting my blanket to be one including cat things. Instead what I received was a blanket with a cat face and dog paws and bones. Additionally the colouring of the blanket is faded, with my cat’s bright green eyes appearing brown and dingy. The blanket is soft. But I would never order from here again for the price of the product and what I received."
PupSocks,2021-01-12T17:55:56Z,1,I was sent the incorrect order and I got a response about a week later. When asked if I wanted a refund/store credit I responded yes and I never got a response back. I was even sent a new pair of socks for free even though I DID NOT ask for it because I had already ordered another pair. Still no response on the refund.....: thanks
PupSocks,2021-01-12T17:55:28Z,1,"Absolutely terrible company. Ordered in November,  Guarentees socks by Christmas and have still not received them by mid January. They haven’t even left Miami yet per the tracking record. Furthermore, the mock up PDF they sent to serve as a Christmas present (instead of the actual socks...) is in the wrong colour so I can only imagine when they socks arrive (if they ever arrive) they will be the wrong colour too. Never never again will I order from these crooks. Wish I had looked at their better business bureau rating and Facebook comments before I had wasted my money. NEVER again."
PupSocks,2021-01-12T17:52:49Z,1,Ordered well before Christmas. No package yet (mid-Jan)Was told the shipper is at fault.Pup-socks perhaps you should sue your shipper.
PupSocks,2021-01-12T17:52:13Z,1,Never received my order placed on 11/30.
PupSocks,2021-01-12T17:50:56Z,1,"I ordered some socks on 12/1/20 and still have not received them. It said it would take 8-10 business days and I was hoping on receiving them before Christmas, with the socks ordered 3 WEEKS in advance. It’s already January 12th, 2021 and I still have not received anything. I do not think this is acceptable, a company like this should be prepared for a holidays and expect excess amounts of orders."
PupSocks,2021-01-12T17:49:58Z,1,Never received my socks...
PupSocks,2021-01-12T17:49:42Z,4,Socks were super cute! The quality of the socks was not wonderful. The pictures faded after 1 wash.
PupSocks,2021-01-12T17:49:36Z,5,I love my pupsocks blanket! It's a great keepsake of our two pups that we'll cherish.
PupSocks,2021-01-12T17:46:56Z,1,"Unfortunately, as much as I really hate giving bad reviews, I need to be honest - I am incredibly disappointed. I ordered my mom a custom pair of socks in the beginning of December, where it was advertised all over the website that if you ordered it would come in time for Christmas. I was so excited to give my mom these socks as my one dog passed away over the summer and I know she would have really appreciated them. The last update I received on my tracking number was December 14th, nearly a month ago. It hasn't been updated since. It hasn't moved whatsoever and I have emailed two times and have yet to receive a response. I am entirely understanding that with COVID times are tough. I really feel for small businesses during this time. However, why I am so disappointed with this is because you specifically advertised that it would come in time for Christmas. I would have even understood it being a week late. But going this long without even an email or any update whatsoever is unprofessional. It shouldn't be advertised if you can't keep that sort of promise, especially during such a time where you know things are unpredictable. I ordered these specifically because I trusted what you were telling me.At this point I would rather get a refund and use that money to shop somewhere else. I was really looking forward to giving this present to my mom."
PupSocks,2021-01-12T17:46:33Z,1,Never received my product and haven't had any customer service help. Horrible.
PupSocks,2021-01-12T17:46:09Z,5,Love the socks! Gift for my daughter. She’s a new dog owner! Absolutely loves them. And they look fantastic!!
PupSocks,2021-01-12T17:44:31Z,4,"Awesome socks!  Picture quality is great.  Only reason I took off one star is the toes area is baggy.  It is two pieces seemed together and so a little to big in the toe area.  Besides that, totally love it!!!"
PupSocks,2021-01-12T17:44:09Z,5,"Great products and service.  Love the socks, mask, & blanket."
PupSocks,2021-01-12T17:41:14Z,2,"Ordered a blanket and a pair of socks December 1. At the time, shipping was 10-15 days. They charged my card immediately, before the items were even made. After 15 days, nothing. I emailed them, and messaged them even on social media. No response, except for a generic automated reply about delays. Eventually got items after Christmas, which was a huge disappointment. No reply from an actually human was a shock. I’ll never from them again."
PupSocks,2021-01-12T17:38:31Z,2,"The socks are lovely.  But one pair was the wrong size, and the mask I ordered (and paid for) never arrived.  I reached out to customer service FOUR times, and never received a reply, just a robo-generated “we are so very busy, we’ll get back to you).  It’s been 5 weeks; I won’t hold my breath."
PupSocks,2021-01-12T17:37:12Z,1,"Not good. I need to return them,"
PupSocks,2021-01-12T17:36:39Z,2,"Still didnt get my order after almost a month.Not the fault of the site, but the delivery is unacceptably slow."
PupSocks,2021-01-12T17:36:25Z,4,"Fantastic, cute socks. Seem sturdy. Wish the photos were a bit sharper/brighter, but that was likely due to my photography skills and not PupSocks production issues!"
PupSocks,2021-01-12T17:35:33Z,1,"Ordered in November. Still don’t have the product in January, which was purchased as a gift for Christmas. Will not recommend."
PupSocks,2021-01-12T17:34:49Z,2,"One of the countless that recieved my wrong order. I reached out to no avail until I disputed the charge. Once I did that I got a response and my correct order. The socks are adorable, they feel a little funny but it was a great late gift. I believe this company stuggles to meet their demand and needs to own up to it. There is potiental here but, according to the BBB, this has been a years long problem with the company. Though my issue is resolved and I am satisfied, I do not recommend their products."
PupSocks,2021-01-12T17:30:13Z,1,"I can't give you more than one star, today is 1/12/21 and still have not received the blanket that I ordered 11/30/20."
PupSocks,2021-01-12T17:29:06Z,5,Super fun product. My daughter in law loved her Pupsocks with the faces of her two beautiful Ridgebacks on them. She knew right away they were her dogs. Easy to order and shipped in a timely manner:)
PupSocks,2021-01-12T17:27:26Z,1,I did not receive what i ordered. It was someone else command
PupSocks,2021-01-12T17:26:39Z,2,"I really wanted to leave a positive review for PupSocks as small businesses need our support right now more than ever. However, my experience was less than what I would hope for from any size company. Their shipping time was hugely delayed due to Covid (which is understandable) and yet there was no communication about it to the customer—even though I had asked them about the status of my order. I did eventually get my Pup Socks and though they are very cute, the quality leaves much to be desired. I will not spend my money on these socks at that price point (and that was a sale!) again. I hope that things can be ironed out now that the chaos of the holidays is over and that they will revisit the materials they use to make these so they can truly be a lasting gift instead of the throwaway one time use that they are."
PupSocks,2021-01-12T17:26:19Z,1,"I ordered a cat blanket. The fabric has flaws in it. The cat is the wrong color(should be grey but you made him brown), you charged me the wrong amount to my visa. You said you were honouring the 30% discount but did not. I want a refund now!"
PupSocks,2021-01-12T17:23:06Z,5,Great product!! Amazing customer service!! Will definitely be ordering in the future!
PupSocks,2021-01-12T17:22:21Z,2,"Ordered 2 pairs of Socks on November 17th, received them on Jan 10th.  One of the two pairs were incorrect.  I sent several messages before Christmas to the company about the delay and didn't hear anything until Jan 7th offering 25% off for the delay. (I have just reached out about the incorrect pair so I do not know how they will reply to that.)  They blamed the pandemic for the delay but if you look, they've had the same problem every holiday season. Before you buy, go check out their BBB rating. The socks aren't a great fabric but for a gag gift are fine and they did a good job with the picture; it does look like my dog.  So if you are ordering at a busy time of year, order months in advance or be prepared for them to not arrive  on time or to be wrong."
PupSocks,2021-01-12T17:21:00Z,1,Never received my order. It’s been a month and a half.
PupSocks,2021-01-12T17:20:54Z,1,Wrong item receivedI place my order on November 30.  Plenty of time for the socks to be produced and arrive before Christmas.  Even allowing for shipping delays from the post office.  My order did not arrive until January 1.  To top it off the socks in my package were not the ones I ordered.  I emailed you to inform you of the mistake on the same day the package arrived.  I have heard from no one in the last 11 days except for an automatic email reply blaming all your issues on the post office.  The post office is not the one's who put the wrong socks in my package.  It's not their fault that you have not contacted me to fix the situation.  I have filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau in the hopes of hearing from someone and to keep this from happening to someone else.  I feel badly for the person who's socks I did receive for they are in the same situation.
PupSocks,2021-01-12T17:19:23Z,2,It took more than one month until 2 pair of socks were delivered (I live in Europe) and to be honest the quality of the socks was rather disappointing.
PupSocks,2021-01-12T17:18:59Z,1,"Customer service is dodging my complaint. The socks are super cute, but you CANNOT WEAR THEM. The material is weird and meshy and the material crumples on the top of your ankle. A total waste of money."
PupSocks,2021-01-12T17:18:51Z,1,I ordered in November and as of today January 12th I have not received my pup socks or blanket ordered for Christmas gift for my son.
PupSocks,2021-01-12T17:17:31Z,1,What was received wasn’t what was ordered.   No return calls or emails.  Going through bank and disputing to get my money back!
PupSocks,2021-01-12T17:16:01Z,5,"I was a little skeptical about this company since many ads on FB are scammy. Luckily, this worked out great. My wife loved the blanket with our recently departed dog on it. Thank you."
PupSocks,2021-01-12T17:15:01Z,4,Socks look great. My boyfriend loved them. I ordered red and they came out more orange so that is my only critique
PupSocks,2021-01-12T17:14:54Z,5,Great quality and a fun gift!
PupSocks,2021-01-12T17:14:52Z,1,I’m very happy with two-thirds of my order. I ordered three socks and only two were correct. A random third sock was sent. I’ve completed two forms online and have yet to receive any confirmation that I would receive my correct sock. Thanks you!
PupSocks,2021-01-12T17:06:59Z,4,"Great product, loved the quality and the ordering process was very easy!Just took a very long time to get to us in Canada, but will definitely order again!"
PupSocks,2021-01-12T16:51:17Z,1,"The one star is for the ease of use and wide selection of options for creating accessories, because that process was great!Once the order was placed though, everything went downhill. I ordered a would-be Christmas gift (long before the cut off for holiday orders) which was about a month from Dec 25th. It’s almost mid January and I still have yet to receive my order. The tracking provided has not been updated since December 19th.After reaching out to customer support to provide my tracking, order and contact info, I was provided with a generic reply that many customers were in the same boat, but with no offer of resolution, or anything to help check on my order status. I cannot rate or comment on the quality of the product, as it has not yet arrived.This should be a great service and is an amazing idea for personalized gifts, but unfortunately the shipment process and customer service is not up to par."
PupSocks,2021-01-12T16:45:31Z,1,"Never received, although they said they were shipped. No response to emails. Terrible."
PupSocks,2021-01-12T16:44:47Z,1,The material is terrible and no matter howYou put them on they bunch up in the front. These aren’t socks they are a tube of printed fabric.
PupSocks,2021-01-12T16:43:32Z,2,"Ordered back in November and just recieved part of my order yesterday (January 11), it was supposed to be guaranteed delivery by Christmas. Still waiting for the other item. Fabric of socks was different than I expected."
PupSocks,2021-01-12T16:35:51Z,1,"Received a pair of socks that had the wrong dog and were the wrong color. Emailed company but never responded. I did receive an email with a picture of the correct socks, but have yet to receive them. Unfortunately read the reviews after I ordered. Seems many have the same problem."
PupSocks,2021-01-12T16:32:12Z,5,Awesome! They were a gift for my girlfriend and she loved them so much she cried. Thank you!
PupSocks,2021-01-12T16:22:37Z,1,"Still waiting for my delivery. Ordered November 30, 2020.  Has been over a month. I have a pair of socks from last year - fit is great, image is holding up despite many washes. Just sad it has taken so long to get this years purchases"
PupSocks,2021-01-12T16:20:43Z,1,"On December 29th I contacted PupSocks customer service department regarding several major issues I had concerning my purchase. It has been two weeks and I have yet to receive a response other than an ""automatic"" response that had nothing to do with the issues at hand. The socks are unwearable and the one mask has a design flaw and no way to adjust the fit."
PupSocks,2021-01-12T16:14:10Z,2,"While the socks look nice, the material is very uncomfortable and they do not fit well. As such, they are unwearable. A fine keepsake, but I wish I had ordered something different."
PupSocks,2021-01-12T16:07:56Z,1,Ordered in November and received after Christmas
PupSocks,2021-01-12T16:03:23Z,4,"I ordered pink socks with an image of our dog for my son.  The color and image turned out great.  My son wears a size 11.5 and the socks were long enough for his feet.  There is a lot of extra room in the toes, so I am giving this 4 stars.  He would like to wear these for his sports but the extra room makes them uncomfortable.  He is wearing them out for short periods of time."
PupSocks,2021-01-12T16:02:26Z,1,"It took over a month to get my order, it wasn’t completely correct. Absolutely no way of contacting anyone at this business. Every time I would try to inquire about my order I received a computer generated response and never got any actual info on my order. I am currently waiting on a refund for part of my order that I still have not received and again received a computer generated response saying my refund would be submitted in 48 hours and that was 5 days ago. Poorly ran business and I will never order another item from this poorly managed business."
PupSocks,2021-01-12T15:59:47Z,1,I ordered 2 pairs of socks and 1 mask for $100 dollars at the end of November. It’s January 12 and they still have not arrived.
PupSocks,2021-01-12T15:59:32Z,5,My family absolutely loved their PupSocks that I got them for Christmas!!!
PupSocks,2021-01-12T15:56:12Z,1,It’s been over 6 weeks and still no socks. Never again. This was supposed to be a Christmas gift.
PupSocks,2021-01-12T15:55:45Z,5,The socks were a Christmas present for my husband. They were a hit! I ordered socks last year for my daughter and her boyfriend and they wear them all the time. The picture is very clear. PupSocks does not disappoint!
PupSocks,2021-01-12T15:53:13Z,5,Great quality socks. Wash well pictures look great too.
PupSocks,2021-01-12T15:34:49Z,1,I couldn’t be more disappointed! I ordered sock for my husband for Christmas (ordered at the end of November) and they still aren’t here. Terrible experience. I will never shop here again and I have shared my horrible experience on many social media platforms.
PupSocks,2021-01-12T15:33:30Z,5,"The second year I've ordered fun things for my kids, and though covid delayed shipping everywhere, the PupSocks team sent out email cards of the design mock-up which I was able to print and stuff in their Christmas stockings. It was that small consideration that will keep my coming back. Thanks PupSocks team, my kids will continue to enjoy getting fun items with their pets on them!"
PupSocks,2021-01-12T15:32:05Z,4,"Unfortunately this gift arrived two weeks after Christmas. Not pup socks fault, but six weeks is a little bit of a bummer. All of that aside, the quality is superb, and the socks vibrant, beautiful colors. The only thing I would change for next time would be to instruct the artists not to edit the faces so tight. Our cats faces were triangles almost as opposed to a little rounder so you can see a little bit more of their fluff. Overall though, excellent job and we will be ordering again!!"
PupSocks,2021-01-12T15:30:04Z,3,"The pictures of my dog came out great, but the quality of the socks themselves is very poor. Probably going to end up hanging up the socks as decor rather than actually wearing them"
PupSocks,2021-01-12T15:23:42Z,2,Ordered Nov. 30 - nothing received yet.
PupSocks,2021-01-12T15:18:18Z,5,My husband LOVED his pup socks and blanket I ordered him for Christmas! He said it was his favorite gift! Very thankful for the great quality and fast service delivery.
PupSocks,2021-01-12T15:11:27Z,1,I never receive my order...... IM still waiting.... I order November 30.........
PupSocks,2021-01-12T15:10:41Z,1,My order is still not here after 2 months. I am extremely disappointed. I have been ignored in my attempts to reach out to customer service. Would not recommend.
PupSocks,2021-01-12T15:06:25Z,4,Would have been 5 stars but the sizing was way off. Medium womens was more the size of a man's large.
PupSocks,2021-01-12T14:43:18Z,1,Order wasn’t processed at the time. Once I emailed to query it they processed it but I never received my order. Not sure if this is a real company or an internet scam.
PupSocks,2021-01-12T14:37:50Z,4,"The photos turned out great and they were super cute but the sock itself is not great quality.   But, it's a fun gift for the novelty factor.  The tracking of production/delivery could have been clearer as well.  Other than that, they were a hit."
PupSocks,2021-01-12T14:19:49Z,1,"My order took forever to arrive and when it did it was wrong.Not my puppy.I've been trying to contact them and get a refund, but no one has been able to email me back for more then two weeks now. Terrible service!"
PupSocks,2021-01-12T14:18:47Z,5,Such a cute mask! It was a Christmas present and my boyfriend loved having our two kitties' faces on it. Fast shipping too. Thank you!
PupSocks,2021-01-12T14:03:24Z,2,Garbage! Christmas gift purchased Right at the beginning of December. Still don't have it. Wow Christmas buzz kill... take ownership don't blame the postal service...
PupSocks,2021-01-12T14:02:42Z,3,Design was nice but the quality of the socks weren’t so great.
PupSocks,2021-01-12T13:54:20Z,1,I received the wrong socks (someone else’s cat) and I have not been able to contact them to have them changed.
PupSocks,2021-01-12T13:36:42Z,5,"Out of all of the gifts that my daughter received this past holiday, her blanket from Pup Socks was BY FAR her most prized item! The material is so very soft and the picture of her pet on the blanket just makes her heart so happy!"
PupSocks,2021-01-12T13:20:17Z,1,"Unfortunately I have not received my order. In addition, there has been no response when I have contacted them regarding a reorder, refund, etc..."
PupSocks,2021-01-12T13:16:45Z,2,"Was very disappointed that it took sooo long and didn’t make Christmas delivery. They were nice, however I had to thread the adjusters on the sides which I would have thought they would have done for the price for the masks."
PupSocks,2021-01-12T13:12:31Z,3,The socks look great with my pups face! BUT unfortunately the fit is not good. I gave them as a gift to my husband and he said they were quite uncomfortable to wear.
PupSocks,2021-01-12T13:07:18Z,3,"I was expecting a regular sock fabric but instead it’s a different kind of material. Also, they’re a little tight and not super extensible."
PupSocks,2021-01-12T12:46:48Z,2,The socks look great! The custom photo print came out good. The only thing is I had them printed on a size small woman’s sock for my 14 year old daughter with a size 7 woman shoe and these socks are huge on her. They loose on my size 10 men’s foot. So kinda of a bummer that she can’t wear them.
PupSocks,2021-01-12T11:59:44Z,1,If I could give them 0 stars I would.  Still have not received my order placed early December.   Support is unreachable.  No phone number to call.   Emails get an automated response saying how unprecedented the season was.   Horrible.  Simply Horrible.
PupSocks,2021-01-12T11:37:48Z,4,"The gift recipient was ecstatic that his dog was on his socks! He absolutely loves them. My only concern is whether, because of the material, the tops will stretch out and fall down. Otherwise, great idea and so many colors/options to choose from."
PupSocks,2021-01-12T11:17:57Z,1,"You are asking for a review but I still have not received my order from end of November, meanwhile you keep sending advertisements to make additional purchases."
PupSocks,2021-01-12T11:16:51Z,1,Received wrong socks!  Has not been corrected.
PupSocks,2021-01-12T10:41:59Z,5,"I ordered 3 pair for Christmas. Due to the times, they were not going to arrive by the 25th. I decided I would take pics of a few gifts for my adult children so they can open a picture of the gift they would be getting soon afterChristmas. Pup socks on their own sentMe a digital card with the exact picture of what the cocks would look like so when they opened the gift it was just as funny as opening the real thing. Days later they all received the best comfiest socks with our French bulldogs face on them!! They love them and wore themImmediately l!"
PupSocks,2021-01-12T10:30:42Z,1,"Placed an order that was never received. Contacted the company with no response. So, they have my money and I have nothing !"
PupSocks,2021-01-12T08:56:11Z,4,"Good quality of the product, nice packaging, it just took really long to receive the order."
PupSocks,2021-01-12T08:41:08Z,1,Socks were an Xmas present. Arrived with someone else’s dog printed on them. I have no idea who’s dog this is! Highly upset!! Let’s see if they can make it right smh
PupSocks,2021-01-12T07:54:58Z,3,These presents were cute and those they were gifted too really liked them BUT ... the communication between and the company and myself as a purchaser was really lacking. I had no idea when the product would be arriving. And the socks themselves aren't great quality or very comfortable
PupSocks,2021-01-12T07:28:29Z,1,I still haven’t received my socks and I ordered them WELL before Christmas. Horrible service.
PupSocks,2021-01-12T05:43:12Z,1,I ordered as a Christmas gift and did not receive for Christmas and still haven’t received my order.
PupSocks,2021-01-12T05:20:45Z,1,I ordered this on 11/30 and as of 1/11 still no socks. It was sad for Christmas for my kids to not have their custom socks.
PupSocks,2021-01-12T05:14:17Z,4,"This company sent me the wrong order during the holiday season and when I tried to reach them it took a long time. However, it was during Christmas 2020 when Covid-19 was affecting supply chain. Also, when they finally did respond to me they sent me a new order fairly quickly (and free of charge) that was perfect to what was advertised. I would recommend them to a friend."
PupSocks,2021-01-12T04:58:28Z,5,The picture of my daughter’s pup was perfect! She loved them!!
PupSocks,2021-01-12T04:54:20Z,4,"Picture is perfect, texture of socks not as expected"
PupSocks,2021-01-12T04:31:37Z,3,"Fast delivery and socks turned out to be very cute.  But, they don't fit correctly.  I ordered the correct size based on shoe size, but the foot portion is too tight and the leg portion is loose and won't stay up.  Also, the socks hit at an awkward area midcalf.  Would have preferred knee socks."
PupSocks,2021-01-12T04:16:36Z,1,Never received my product. It’s been 1 month since sending my complaint email and haven’t had a response yet
PupSocks,2021-01-12T03:15:25Z,1,I ordered my socks in November! It’s January now and I still haven’t received my Order. To make matters worse my emails are not being responded to and there is no Customer support number I can call. I just want what I have paid for already no tracking number was ever given. I am not happy at all with any of this experience.
PupSocks,2021-01-12T03:03:39Z,1,"These socks took FOREVER to arrive. I ordered them 12/10 as a Christmas gift, and they arrived 1/11. Granted I'm in Canada, and this past Christmas was crazy for deliveries. Fine, whatever. The socks are super cute and the print quality is actually quite good... but honestly, who designed these socks!? They look like they are meant to fit the leg of a table and not someones foot (really wish I could post a picture, it's pretty comical). The material is awful. No one in their right mind would wear these on their feet, unless they hated their feet with a passion. Poor value for what I paid. Super disappointed."
PupSocks,2021-01-12T02:46:41Z,5,Great socks. Love that you can customize.
PupSocks,2021-01-12T02:44:24Z,5,Super cute and they were a hit! Considering it was a custom order for Christmas I was worried it wouldn’t arrive in time but they were delivered as scheduled. Will definitely order again!
PupSocks,2021-01-12T02:37:44Z,4,We loved the socks and the pictures came out amazing. It would be nice to have more options of colors and cotton blends.
PupSocks,2021-01-12T02:29:53Z,5,Great prints! My aunts loved their gifts.
PupSocks,2021-01-12T02:28:04Z,2,Our socks came after Christmas and they were far too expensive to be late.
PupSocks,2021-01-12T02:24:34Z,1,I completely understand that the 2020 holiday season was absolutely crazy but when my order was messed up and I sent 3 emails asking for it to be corrected (even just a refund of the product I did not receive) and I never once received a reply that addressed my problem. The only reply I ever received was an automated message that they were working to get caught up on emails. That was December 19th which said they were about 24 hours behind on responding. 2 emails later and I have still not received a response. I unfortunately would never recommend this company to anyone because of their complete lack of customer service.
PupSocks,2021-01-12T02:23:21Z,5,Our PupSocks turned out awesome and we’re delivered quickly!
PupSocks,2021-01-12T02:16:46Z,1,I ordered 3 masks and only 2 arrived (with a significant delay - took 3 weeks). I have sent several emails regarding this over the last 2 weeks with no response! I was still charged for the missing item. The customer service is terrible.
PupSocks,2021-01-12T02:10:45Z,1,my order didn't arrive
PupSocks,2021-01-12T02:07:04Z,1,Where is my order? I have never received and it was a gift.
PupSocks,2021-01-12T02:02:47Z,1,I bought a pair of the socks for my Wife as a Christmas gift. Not only did they take over a month to arrive but they're made out of some really plastic/vinyl feeling material on top of having no shape of any kind and being absurdly large.They're literally just an oversized tube with no shape or design resembling anything like a foot. My wife's feet are size 10 and they're massive on her. Not to mention that they bunch up on the bridge of her foot because again.... They have no shape.If you like wearing gimmicky vinyl tubes on your feet that serve no purpose. These are for you.
PupSocks,2021-01-12T01:44:47Z,1,I ordered pup socks as a Chris gift on Black Friday. I received the wrong pair of socks 3 weeks later. I understand how there can be a mix up but I didn’t even receive a response via email for 10 days. Needless to say I finally received the correct pair well after Christmas and even New Years. By then my daughter had gone back to college and I had to pay to ship them there. The company obviously couldn’t handle the influx of orders but they could have express shipped them in time for Christmas which is what I requested!
PupSocks,2021-01-12T01:38:44Z,1,"I ordered on 11/26 and package was lost on 12/6.  My four emails to ask about product were ignored or answered late and ultimately I was told what I could see on package tracking.  I was then asked if I wanted the order redone.  I agreed and weeks later with no update, socks that were not the right color with some other dogs face arrived at my door on 1//11/21.  I planned to try and give my husband a personalized Christmas gift and then a birthday gift and I am getting neither at this point.  Its not that I don't want to support small businesses and realize the postal service jammed companies up but I still don't have the product I ordered and of all things I get a reminder to do a review.  So here it is.  DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY.  Even when things go wrong they can't get it fixed."
PupSocks,2021-01-12T01:34:24Z,3,"The socks themselves are great however, I was buying socks for a 3 and 5 year old and specifically requested kids sizes.  What arrived were adult sizes a week before Christmas so I had no recourse.  VERY disappointing.   At least the donation was for a good cause."
PupSocks,2021-01-12T01:32:34Z,1,"Order was placed December 7th, but not received until after well after Christmas.  Sent an email requesting credit with no response.  On top of that the socks were very poor quality when they finally did come.  You will be disappointed, don't order"
PupSocks,2021-01-12T01:27:25Z,5,Very satisfied even with the postal delay
PupSocks,2021-01-12T01:13:30Z,1,"Never received my order, any explanation or my money back. Terrible company."
PupSocks,2021-01-12T01:10:31Z,5,"The quality of the socks and masks were excellent! For a custom order especially, the delivery was as promised. I would from here again."
PupSocks,2021-01-12T01:04:48Z,4,"I ordered the socks and mask on 11/30 and they arrived after Christmas... that was disappointing but ALL mail was delayed... The year before, while I don’t remember exact dates, the socks I ordered were received before Christmas.  Adorable items!!!"
PupSocks,2021-01-12T00:50:21Z,1,"This product is horrible. Do not order. I order socks for my entire family for Xmas. Order arrived 3 months later, and the product is unwearable. During the printing process the heat of the print breaks down the elasticity of the sock. When you stretch to put the socks on, the print breaks apart. The sock itself has no elasticity, doesn’t fit the foot and is like a tube- no heel shape."
PupSocks,2021-01-12T00:30:43Z,5,Ordered a blanket for my daughter with a picture of her cat.  The picture is clear. The blanket is soft.  She loves it!
PupSocks,2021-01-12T00:27:35Z,4,"We received out order late due to Covid - no problem.  But along with our order, someone else's socks were mistakenly sent to us.  I sent an email asking what to do and I received a standard mass email (I assume) explaining that the orders were late due to the backup with the US mail.  I sent another one stating that was not my issue and I'm waiting to hear back.  I just felt bad that someone didn't receive what they were waiting for."
PupSocks,2021-01-12T00:19:26Z,1,"I ordered socks for my children. It took about 25 days to receive them. When I emailed asking for updates, not one person responded to me. I finally got a response about a week after I received the socks! The picture on the socks is fantastic, but the sock shape is bizarre. It’s flat and wide and in no way it would even fit my kids! I ordered the child size and they fit me. It honestly was a waste of $45! So disappointed. Save your money."
PupSocks,2021-01-12T00:16:45Z,5,I ordered 3 pairs of socks for Christmas for 3 different people with 3 different dogs. The socks were awesome and were the hit of Christmas!
PupSocks,2021-01-12T00:14:40Z,2,"I ordered 3 pair of socks.  All the same.  When I received the order on 12/24, I received two correct pair and one pair that was a picture of someone we don’t know.  I still have not received a reply to my email requesting how to fix it."
PupSocks,2021-01-12T00:11:47Z,5,Exactly as promised - I'm amazed they can take a photograph and create a beautiful face on the socks!
PupSocks,2021-01-12T00:10:05Z,1,"Never received my blanket I ordered on November 29. Received a mass email response to my inquiries. Still receive promotional emails everyday urging me to buy socks and bragging about their fast turn around times. This company sucks not because of shipping delays which might be related to pandemic, but because it does not respond to emails and pretends like thousands of people aren’t still waiting for their orders while they happily try to get more money from people."
PupSocks,2021-01-12T00:00:51Z,1,We waited five weeks for our order to arrive. We ordered a pair of blue socks with two different pictures of our dog on them. We received white socks with one picture of someone else’s dog on them. I have emailed the company twice with no response. I have sent them a Facebook message with no response and I have commented on their Facebook page with no response. I will soon be calling my credit card company to reverse the charge.
PupSocks,2021-01-11T23:59:43Z,1,"Not impressed.  The socks aren't very soft.  The picture of my dog looked blurry and the cut out was a hack job.  There was a 2nd pair of socks with a random dog on it.  Not sure if I was supposed to get (2) pairs of socks, if this was an extra pair, and if so, why do I want a pair of socks with a random dog on them?"
PupSocks,2021-01-11T23:59:04Z,1,The editing of my cats image was done extremely poorly.  They were gifts to the pets owners and they couldn’t even tell it was their pet.
PupSocks,2021-01-11T23:57:26Z,1,"I ordered my pupsocks on November 28 and received an email that I would receive them in 12-15 business days.  I received an email on December 11th that my order had shipped.  It is now January 11 and I still don't have my order.  It was promised to arrive between December 15 - 18.  When I check the tracking of my package it is still sitting at the first stage ""Shipment information received""."
PupSocks,2021-01-11T23:54:10Z,1,"I ordered PUPSOCKS for Christmas presents in November 2020.We are now is 2021 and I still don't have them.Appreciate they sent me a mock up but really disappointed I could not give these as gifts for Christmas.I would have to really think twice before ordering from them again.Sincerely,Derek"
PupSocks,2021-01-11T23:53:28Z,1,"Extremely disappointed.   Horrible customer service.   I ordered November 24th and as of 1/11/2021 I have not received my order.  I received someone elses pet, which was poor quality and the fabric felt uncomfortable.   I would love to send this out to it's rightful owner; however,  I only get a scripted response blaming USPS from the CEO.  Wake up CEO it's not USPS' fault.  Your product is overpriced,  poor quality, horrible material and even worse customer service.  DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY.  I've asked repeatedly for a refund without a response. I do not recommend this product or company."
PupSocks,2021-01-11T23:50:35Z,4,Love the socks and mask i ordered for Christmas. My husband thought the socks looked odd and wasn’t sure about wearing them but once he put them on he said they were very comfortable and loves them! The order took over 4 weeks to arrive as they were overwhelmed with orders and I suspect COVID impacts. They ended up coming the day before Christmas so I was thrilled. They had sent an email for me to print and wrap should the package not arrive in time so I was pleased. The delay was the only reason I didn’t give 5 stars.
PupSocks,2021-01-11T23:47:02Z,5,Although it arrived after Christmas because the usps was overwhelmed w/ more parcels than ever before.  The throw arrived it was soft and the pictures of my pet were bright and beautiful.  The throw is very soft.  Very happy overall
PupSocks,2021-01-11T23:44:17Z,1,Very very very bad service! I purchased two pair of socks in November... not received them yet! No communication No explainationHorrible!! I want my money back
PupSocks,2021-01-11T23:40:28Z,1,"The post office being backed up did not have everything to do with my order being delayed. Pupsocks was simply extremely delayed in shipping the order out. It took them over 3 weeks from date of purchase to even ship them. I ordered another pair 2 weeks after my initial order and those shipped at the SAME time as my earlier order. So one order took 3 weeks to ship while the next only took 1? I paid for expedited shipping on the one I placed late and would have done the same for the first one had I known they wouldn’t be shipping it for 3 weeks. They have had zero communication outside of an automated response to my two attempts to contact them in hopes they would make this right. Very disappointed, mostly in the complete lack of customer service."
PupSocks,2021-01-11T23:37:31Z,3,"They look really cute, not necessarily the most wearable. Kind of a strange fabric, they have seams on the side that are kind of uncomfortable and they bunch up around the ankle."
PupSocks,2021-01-11T23:33:35Z,5,My husband loved his socks with his dog on them.  Great gift!
PupSocks,2021-01-11T23:33:33Z,3,"The socks looked cute, but the material was very strange and the fit was not great."
PupSocks,2021-01-11T23:17:57Z,3,"I was pleased with the three pairs of socks that had my dog on them. The extra pair I ordered had someone else’s dog. I emailed twice asking for a response about what to do and did not get any return email, even though I sent an amusing “which of these is not like the other”photo. I thought that might more likely get a response, but no luck. :(."
PupSocks,2021-01-11T23:15:24Z,5,"so cute, the perfect christmas gift!"
PupSocks,2021-01-11T23:05:48Z,1,One order never arrived.  Took my money no problem and them memory holed the transaction.
PupSocks,2021-01-11T23:05:35Z,5,The socks were perfect and a big hit for Christmas! I liked that they kept me updated on the status of my order. Thank you!
PupSocks,2021-01-11T23:05:04Z,5,"So cute, my niece loves wearing her babies!"
PupSocks,2021-01-11T23:02:01Z,3,"Great execution of the picture, but my husband doesn't wear his socks. They fit very weird and aren't comfy."
PupSocks,2021-01-11T22:54:45Z,2,"Ordered on 11/30.  Still haven’t received order as of 1/11.  Blamed post office on 12/20.  Yet, still don’t have my order.  Gave me choice of having order resent, which I accepted.  Never heard from them again.  Oh, they did send me a pic of what the socks would have looked like, though.  Shall I continue?"
PupSocks,2021-01-11T22:49:32Z,1,I never received my personalized socks that were suppose to be a Christmas gift. I have emailed the company several times and all I get back is a generic response. Horrible customer service
PupSocks,2021-01-11T22:46:36Z,1,I ordered the items well in advance of Christmas as they were presents for my girls and they only arrived last week. In addition the face masks are a terrible design and don't fit and the material the socks are made from is unbearable. Disappointed in an understatement
PupSocks,2021-01-11T22:39:36Z,3,These were Christmas gifts that arrived January 10th.  The images on one of the masks were not very well done.  The cats ears on both images were cut off.
PupSocks,2021-01-11T22:29:09Z,1,"BEWARE! Possible SCAM COMPANY! I place an order in Nov 2020 and on Jan 4, 2021 I received the WRONG order. I have contacted the company multiple times only to receive generic automated responses and no follow-up Since my difficulties I have read countless other posts of individuals who have never received their order and/or have received wrong orders and the company never corrected the mistakes or refunded their monies. I am currently still waiting for assistance to resolve my issues."
PupSocks,2021-01-11T22:25:28Z,3,"Customer service was great. Shipping was really slow and didn't make it before Christmas as indicated it would, but that's the norm right now with most shipping. The image of our puppy was a bit cartoonish, but did look like her. Socks are thin dress sock material. Overall they're a cute thoughtful gift"
PupSocks,2021-01-11T22:22:51Z,1,"I placed my order Nov 30, 2020 as of today's date Jan 11, 2021 I stil have not received my Christmas present order. I also still have no update or idea when this will be delivered. Generic reply emails have been sent to me blaming covid for delays. I don't find this a satisfactory response and do not know at this point if I should be calling my credit card company to claim non delivery of the items ordered."
PupSocks,2021-01-11T22:22:03Z,1,The fabric they used for the socks is poor at best.  The only thing worse than the fabric is the shape the sew it.  It will not conform to any standard sized foot.  Too bad as these could be really cool if there was some quality materials and craftsmanship involved.
PupSocks,2021-01-11T22:21:52Z,5,"Pup socks for everyone! I was looking for a fun, unique gift for all of my new brother-in-laws -- and Pup Socks were the obvious choice! My husband loves his and as dog crazy as the rest of my family is, I knew they would love wearing these personalized socks!!"
PupSocks,2021-01-11T22:20:14Z,1,I have now waited 42 days for the socks I ordered to be delivered. Really really lousy service!!!
PupSocks,2021-01-11T22:15:53Z,1,"I'm sorry for the low grade, but I don't even have all of my items yet and I ordered them over a month ago to arrive by Christmas. I sent an email a week ago trying to find out where my blanket is and haven't gotten more than a generic response back.  The response did say it will take awhile since you are back-logged with complaints on late deliveries, but I would have expected to hear back by now. I was also told that I would get a mock-up of the blanket prior to Christmas and never got that either. I got one for the socks, but not the blanket.  The socks have arrived and although they are so cute with the dog on them, the material is odd and not comfy at all.  I fear the blanket material wont be nice either.  wishing now that I hadn't ordered at all."
PupSocks,2021-01-11T22:11:44Z,1,Worst customer service experience EVER!  I did not receive the correct order  (someone's dog instead of the cat print I submitted) and then it took weeks in between to correspond instead of the 72 hours they claim they need.  When I finally received their response - it was like they didn't even read my email!  I have since written to them again but don't expect a response anytime soon. I've had better service with orders made in and shipped from China!
PupSocks,2021-01-11T21:59:46Z,5,This was a gift and they loved it
PupSocks,2021-01-11T21:56:30Z,1,"If I could give this company zero stars I would.Ordered two pairs of socks for a gift in November, they claim to have been shipped for weeks, never received them until January, too late to be given as a gift. I am now stuck with two pairs of socks that aren't even my dog! Even better, they're men's socks and would be too big for me.I sent numerous emails, messaged on social media and never got a response for five weeks! DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY!!"
PupSocks,2021-01-11T21:54:54Z,1,Awful overpriced product. Completely unwearable garbage. Don’t buy. Scam. Look them up on the BBB.
PupSocks,2021-01-11T21:51:06Z,5,After receiving the incorrect package first they provide me with my correct order. Great communication and product. Thanks.
PupSocks,2021-01-11T21:49:56Z,1,Super slow to ship. Cheap quality. Earloops on facemask were ridiculously large.  Way overpriced for quality of product.
PupSocks,2021-01-11T21:49:19Z,1,My order was highly delayed. That should’ve been disclosed at the time of order. I was sent a picture to print out and give as the gift for Christmas. The quality of the socks is garbage. There’s no give to them whatsoever.
PupSocks,2021-01-11T21:47:09Z,1,Was sent the wrong item. Tried getting in touch with someone a few times and nothing. Wouldn't go back again
PupSocks,2021-01-11T21:42:32Z,1,I still don’t have my product
PupSocks,2021-01-11T21:40:07Z,1,I'm unable to review the product as I am STILL waiting for it to arrive. Not impressed with the lack of communication and the shipping time.
PupSocks,2021-01-11T21:37:18Z,5,"The socks are great, this is the second pair I’ve ordered (both were gifts). I ordered the socks early/mid December for xmas gift, the socks came in soooo quickly, maybe a week or 10 days after ordering. I did accidentally ship the socks to the wrong house, but I realized my mistake quickly and talked to customer service immediately. They were able to change the shipment location."
PupSocks,2021-01-11T21:37:12Z,5,"This was a Christmas gift.  This was 2 picture pup sock. They turned out perfect!  The only issue was not the fault of anyone, but the extra time in production and shipping due to the ""pandemic"" they arrived just before Christmas.   Luckily I did not have to ship out myself.   Thank You."
PupSocks,2021-01-11T21:31:12Z,5,These were the perfect gift!! The picture quality was amazing!
PupSocks,2021-01-11T21:21:56Z,2,"Took much longer to receive item than what was guaranteed. It took the company 5 days just to ship the item out. The product itself is mediocre at best. Material is soft but extremely thin. There is no material between the 2 thin layers. And the print is not extremely clear. I believe the product is overpriced without any coupons and even still is on the high end with coupons for such low quality, not to mention how long it took to get. Would not purchase again. I’d give it a 1 star, but the only reason I gave it 2 stars is because the person receiving the gift liked it."
PupSocks,2021-01-11T21:17:55Z,5,Good quality and easy to order. It was an excellent Christmas gift. My friend loves the socks.
PupSocks,2021-01-11T21:16:19Z,1,"I received a pair of socks with the wrong dog on them.  I have communicated several times with them but have not received the replacement pair of socks. If I receive the correct socks, I will change my review."
PupSocks,2021-01-11T21:03:38Z,1,I ordered a pair of socks with my two dogs on them . I received a pair of socks with somebody's cat on them. Then I recieved an email with the correct picture of my dogs on a pair of socks asking me how I like my socks. I DONT LIKE THEM. I HATE CATS.  I just wanted a pair of socks with my dogs on them.
PupSocks,2021-01-11T20:59:34Z,1,1 star so far because it’s been well over a month and I still haven’t received my order.
PupSocks,2021-01-11T20:56:17Z,5,Love our blanket!
PupSocks,2021-01-11T20:53:36Z,1,I still haven’t received my order I placed in November. Still haven’t heard back from customer service. Horrible company to work with.
PupSocks,2021-01-11T20:47:02Z,1,Received the wrong order after waiting over a month and the quality is awful! I don't understand why it's so hard to get a hold of someone at customer service and how can you be charging $25 USD and $30 CAD for these socks!!!! I want a refund ASAP
PupSocks,2021-01-11T20:44:38Z,5,"These socks have pictures of my cat's face on them, which makes my feet happy."
PupSocks,2021-01-11T20:43:34Z,1,"My socks arrived after Christmas, I guess to no fault of their own, but I did order them on Nov.30th. When the socks arrived they had the wrong image on one pair. I have contacted Customer Service several times with only a robotic email reply back to my email...the same reply each time. I am looking for a refund on my order. Not only is the wrong image on one pair of the socks but they are extremely uncomfortable. They are baggy in areas and tight in others. The fit just isn't right. If someone would have gotten back to me to resolve the issue of the wrong image then maybe my rating would have been a 3."
PupSocks,2021-01-11T20:43:27Z,5,"The PupSocks were the highlight of gift giving this season! The resolution was amazing, communication was top notch, and best of all - everyone loves their new socks ❤️"
PupSocks,2021-01-11T20:37:26Z,2,I never got my order :(
PupSocks,2021-01-11T20:23:46Z,3,The socks are cute. The don’t fit snug like a sock though. And after one wash my sons socks have pilled up bad. Oh well.
PupSocks,2021-01-11T20:23:36Z,1,You sent me the wrong socks. It took contacting you three times over your page and 5 comments on Facebook to hear anything back from anyone. The socks I got are cheap and I don’t understand how you’re charging $26 a pair!
PupSocks,2021-01-11T20:00:21Z,1,I still haven't received my socks
PupSocks,2021-01-11T20:00:17Z,1,I have NEVER received. Disappointed in the lack of customer service
PupSocks,2021-01-11T19:49:21Z,1,"After several emails back and forth promising that my order will be corrected, I still have not received my corrected order. I've given up. It's an hour of my life I will never get back. I went with MyPhotoSocks.com and received my order in a timely manner. Someone out there received a pair of doberman socks and I received their cocker spaniel."
PupSocks,2021-01-11T19:42:18Z,3,I still have not received my order placed on 11/30/20.  It is now 1/11/21.  I've contacted the company and no one has responded to me directly.  Tracking number just says it is in shipment.
PupSocks,2021-01-11T19:40:43Z,1,Pup socks won’t  unsubscribe me no matter that I have unsubscribed multiple times.
PupSocks,2021-01-11T19:40:41Z,1,Haven't received ordered that had a guaranteed delivery by Christmas. No notice was given that I wouldn't be receiving my Christmas presents for my family. I've e-mail the company multiple times with no response. Currently they have taken my money and not given me my order or a refund.
PupSocks,2021-01-11T19:36:53Z,1,It has been about 1 month and I have yet to receive my product or any meaningful communication other than a coupe of auto “thank you for your patience” emails. It’s unfortunate as the mock up looks great.
PupSocks,2021-01-11T19:34:58Z,1,"I ordered a package of 4–1 L, 1M, 2 child sized. They all came in Large and took over a month to ship."
PupSocks,2021-01-11T19:34:24Z,1,I ordered my socks on November 30th. It’s January 11th and I haven’t received them. I sent an email to the company but haven’t received a response either.
PupSocks,2021-01-11T19:33:13Z,1,I can not leave a review on the product since I have no received them yet. These were originally Christmas gifts for my 2 girlfriends but am disappointed. Hopefully when I receive them they will be worth it.
PupSocks,2021-01-11T19:19:16Z,1,"We loved our blank and the mask we received.  However, they didn't send one of our masks and have not responded to two emails from me requesting a credit or a mask."
PupSocks,2021-01-11T19:14:15Z,1,still have yet to receive the product
PupSocks,2021-01-11T19:11:38Z,1,"I received the wrong pair of socks. I attempted to contact customer service via the websites form, and also directly emailed team @pupsocks.com with no success in reaching anyone so far. I have no choice but to give a 1 star until someone contacts me and provides the correct pair of socks please. Cell phone would be my preferred method of contact. (408) 644-6112"
PupSocks,2021-01-11T19:10:17Z,1,"Ordered my wife a pair of custom socks on December 1st as a stocking stuffer, on December 17th I received an order with the completely wrong photo on the socks. After multiple emails I finally heard back from the company on December 28th, after they claim they're going to ship out the correct order it is now January 11th and I've haven't heard anything back."
PupSocks,2021-01-11T19:09:46Z,3,"The socks were much bigger than I expected and the second pair did not have the image as I requested.  Having said this, they were a gift and the person really liked them anyway."
PupSocks,2021-01-11T19:09:35Z,1,"I think it's interesting that I am being asked to give a review when I've been unable to get a response or any help getting my correct order sent to me.  I placed my order Nov. 30, received an order not even close to mine on Dec. 12, and contacted PupSocks immediately.  I emailed again on Dec. 17 because I heard nothing other than an automated message that I'd hear back within 72 hours.  On Dec. 19, I heard back that they were committed to making this right, and to send a photo of the incorrect item I was sent, which I did immediately, as well as sending the information of my original order.  I heard nothing, Christmas came and went (which annoyed me because it was a Christmas present and I should have had it in time), so I sent another email on Dec. 26.  On Dec. 28, I got an apologetic email saying they created a replacement order and I would receive tracking information when it shipped.  I heard nothing after that.  On Jan. 7, I sent another email asking if it had been shipped, when I'd receive it, and if they would expedite it.  No response until today when I am asked to review my order.  I'm pretty peeved about it.  I have ordered from PupSocks before and got what I ordered, so I expected the same this time.  I've not gotten my order, and I'm not even getting help with making it right."
PupSocks,2021-01-11T19:00:36Z,3,Second time ordering. System gave me error and appeared order did not submit. Placed order again and discovered both orders submitted. IMMEDIATELY sent email to explain and cancel one of the orders. No response later found place on website to cancel 2nd order but still got charged $36. Disappointing. Processing very delayed and items not shipped for 20 days so arrived after Christmas- know partly due to covid. Happy with how socks turned out but would hesitate to order again do to poor communication
PupSocks,2021-01-11T18:55:43Z,1,The blanket was horrible
PupSocks,2021-01-11T18:50:46Z,3,"Happy with the ordering process but it seems my order still has not been shipped. Granted the delivery is to Australia, but I have ordered the product at the beginning of December 2020"
PupSocks,2021-01-11T18:50:42Z,5,Ordered two different masks for Christmas this year.  Both arrived before Christmas and had great pictures of the recipients dogs face on them.
PupSocks,2021-01-11T18:40:34Z,1,"Hi, am I ever going to receive the product I ordered in November? It’s January. Not even an update. You were quick to take my money though!"
PupSocks,2021-01-11T18:39:25Z,1,"Received the wrong orderI ordered a pair of socks that had my two dogs with ""Super Dad"" on them. The order was placed on November 30 and I finally received them on January 8. I was so excited to open them, only to receive a pair of socks that had horses on them. I'm pretty frustrated, as I waited a long time to receive them, only to receive the wrong order. I am awaiting a response from their customer service team, but I do not think I will be purchasing any products from them in the future, nor will I be recommending this company to anyone."
PupSocks,2021-01-11T18:37:27Z,1,I still haven't received my product and have emailed the company 4 times requesting an update.
PupSocks,2021-01-11T18:32:45Z,1,"Poor experience from start to endPlaced order before the end of November as a Christmas gift, but only received it on the 28th of December. Emails to PupSocks were not replied to, and their email on late shipment also carried incorrect information. When they arrived, the socks did not fit well and were of a strange quality - these are less comfortable than cotton socks, FYI. Do not recommend."
PupSocks,2021-01-11T18:25:39Z,1,Never received my purchased product
PupSocks,2021-01-11T18:22:52Z,1,"I am very dissatisfied with the company I sent a picture of our dog and I got socks with cats on them, I have sent an email and just said we are overwhelmed and will get back to me???"
PupSocks,2021-01-11T18:22:03Z,1,"After at least three follow up emails; I have not received my order, nor have they re-issed my order. There has been no response regarding returning my payment. VERY DISAPPOINTED"
PupSocks,2021-01-11T18:18:53Z,5,Love the socks and blankets and they did a great job.
PupSocks,2021-01-11T18:15:24Z,1,Arrived one month late and was missing one of my items. When I requested an explanation I received no response and no refund for the missing item.
PupSocks,2021-01-11T18:15:06Z,5,loved the custom socks great item Thank you
PupSocks,2021-01-11T18:14:37Z,3,They did a great job getting the face on the socks but the material was just really weird and off. It rolls down when you wear them
PupSocks,2021-01-11T18:13:37Z,1,Still waiting on my order from November.....
PupSocks,2021-01-11T18:11:22Z,1,"Screwed up $70 blanket, did not follow simple instructions on the picture and did not put the right face on blanket. Won't order from again.  Contacted them regarding this 3weeks ago and have yet to get a response regarding a refund or return or at least ship me the right product."
PupSocks,2021-01-11T18:08:48Z,1,I still have not received my socks that I ordered November 28. How do I go about getting a refund. This is ridiculous. Alicia
PupSocks,2021-01-11T18:08:03Z,1,I still have not received my order. I ordered 2 pairs of socks for my husband for Christmas on November 30th. It is now January 11th and I still have not received them.
PupSocks,2021-01-11T18:03:36Z,1,"This is a scam. I ordered socks for my father for Christmas with both of his dogs on them in the Christmas red color. What I recieved were blue socks with a black pit-bull that is NOT my dog. I’ve tried to get in contact about a refund and got the ring around. They said they would be sending me a replacement but that never happened either. This was a waste of 30 dollars. Even if I had gotten the socks, the material of the socks is awful."
PupSocks,2021-01-11T18:03:02Z,1,I have tried to contact you to send them back.  It looks like your printer ran out of ink snd the dog is purple.  Good quality sock. Not so good on the print job for the price.  Please contact me so i can either get a refund or you remake the socks.
PupSocks,2021-01-11T18:01:23Z,5,"I ordered 2 pairs for Christmas gifts and they were a big hit! They shipped in plenty of time, and the picture in the socks looks great!"
PupSocks,2021-01-11T17:58:29Z,1,"ZERO STARS!!  DO NOT PURCHASE FROM THESE PEOPLE UNTIL YOU CHECK OUT THEIR BBB RATING!!  This was my biggest mistake.  The ruined our surprise at Christmas when they late shipped (they'll tell you it was USPS, but it wasn't) 2 DIFFERENT blankets I ordered. They arrived 1 week AFTER Christmas and ended up shipping pictures of the wrong frickin' dog!  I place my order on 12/3 and got them almost 1 month later. ALSO, THEY HAVE NO PHONE NUMBER TO CALL AND NO ONLINE CHAT!  You have to send them an email and keep your fingers crossed they respond (which they don't...it's an automated response at best 3-5 days later).  I'm reaching out to my bank to have them credit my account for fraudulence then maybe they'll call me back."
PupSocks,2021-01-11T17:57:20Z,2,For the picture of our pup on the sock it was great. The quality of the stock is the worst I have ever seen. Given the price of the rocky socks you should be ashamed of yourself. You are a scammer.
PupSocks,2021-01-11T17:56:38Z,5,During the busy pre holiday rush I placed an order for a blanket but sent an over edited photo. Realizing my error I tried to contact customer service but was told all they could do was cancel the order. I did that but they cancelled another order I had placed instead. Lastly they made this right by allowing me to correct my pet image and receive the correct order at no charge. Great work. These guys are great and have me as a customer and spokesperson. Products are received enthusiastically and very quality.
PupSocks,2021-01-11T17:53:34Z,1,I still haven’t gotten my socks. I ordered them on November 30th (I am writing this on January 11) and there is no estimated delivery date. I hope when they arrive that they are worth the wait.
PupSocks,2021-01-11T17:52:05Z,1,I can not say anything positive about the order as I HAVE YET TO RECIEVE IT!!!! I placed the order in November is still not here MID JANUARY!! I am honestly not impressed. WHEN CONTACTING THE COMPANY i GOT A FORM LETTER AS A REPLY! If you want merchandise in a timely manner I suggest you go elswhere!
PupSocks,2021-01-11T17:51:21Z,1,I received the wrong item after waiting for over a month. I have reached out multiple times and have never heard back from this company or gotten my order fixed. It was a Christmas present that I ordered in Nov. I didn’t receive it til after Christmas. I just want to be able to give my sister her present.
PupSocks,2021-01-11T17:49:12Z,1,I placed my order 11/29 with estimated shipping time 5-7 days. I received a USPS tracking number December 11th. The tracking number and label was created but USPS had not received my order yet. It is now January 11th and when I check tracking # it still says label created. I have sent several emails and if I get any response at all it is a generated generic email because I have received the exact same email three times. I would not recommend buying from this company if I could have selected 0 stars I would have. After the fact I realized they are NOT approved by the better business bureau because of people having the same thing happen to them and not ever getting product or refund.
PupSocks,2021-01-11T17:48:46Z,5,"Super cute socks, I ordered two pairs one for a pet that passed this year and my son loved them. Thank you so much!"
PupSocks,2021-01-11T17:48:38Z,2,"PROS-They do what they say they'll do: put a picture on socks.CONS-Shipment was very late. -Socks themselves and image were very poor quality. Good for a laugh when you get them, but they're probably going in the bin soon..."
PupSocks,2021-01-11T17:48:00Z,4,The mask were not put together.  It was difficult to add the little pieces to the straps.  Loved the picture and quality!
PupSocks,2021-01-11T17:45:53Z,5,Turned out amazing! Quality is also top notch!
PupSocks,2021-01-11T17:41:12Z,1,I have never written a negative review in my life because it affects the company. However I’m still waiting for the correct cat socks that I ordered back in November. Puppy socks came instead and I have sent emails back-and-forth four times trying to get my order straight as of today January 2021 I still haven’t received the cat socks that I ordered back in November. So my advice to you is go somewhere else! I am not pleased with this company at all. They do not get back to you. There is no phone number for customer service. I’m very very disappointed in a company that advertises great service then doesn't come through for me. I promise to evaluate this company if and when I get my cat socks.
PupSocks,2021-01-11T17:39:17Z,1,"To review a product, I would need to have it first. It's 2 months and I'm still waiting for my package."
PupSocks,2021-01-11T17:37:21Z,5,"Love these!  Ordered a mask & pair of men’s socks, they came out great & made an awesome gift!!!"
PupSocks,2021-01-11T17:36:47Z,1,"Absolutely terrible. I ordered socks in November to have in time for a Christmas gift, took 3 weeks to get to me and once it finally got here it was completely wrong. Wrong color, pattern, and pet. After attempting to reach out multiple times I never got a response back until AFTER Christmas and was told I could get a refund if I would like. I responded saying yes since my gift was ruined. It’s been 2 weeks and I still haven’t heard back again and no refund, despite me emailing multiple times since in order to confirm the refund. Do not order from here!!"
PupSocks,2021-01-11T17:35:52Z,1,I finally received my socks about a month and a half after ordering.  The socks that are pictured in your ad appear to be pretty nice socks but the actual socks are poor quality and will not hold up after even one wash.  I wish the socks were nicer cotton.
PupSocks,2021-01-11T17:35:52Z,1,I ordered two pair of socks in late November of 2020 for Christmas.  It is now January 10 and they have still not showed up.  Very disappointed with time frames.
PupSocks,2021-01-11T17:31:49Z,1,"Failed on every level. Delayed shipment, projected times that they never met, poor correspondence, and ultimately, after over 40 days, once I received the product, the order was COMPLETELY wrong. Now they've stopped responding.  I'd get a refund, if I could get them to reply. I've reached out to my bank's fraud department."
PupSocks,2021-01-11T17:31:43Z,1,"I did not receive my custom order, although they got my pictures. I was sent a pair with a random cat on it now my daughters dogs! I sent multiple emails and no one has addressed this error."
PupSocks,2021-01-11T17:29:38Z,3,"Once I FINALLY received my order for 2 face masks, I was disappointed to find that the ear loops did not have the ability to be made smaller.  They did come with 2 little rubber things to add, but the holes were so small, you can't fit the elastic through.  The mask just falls off my daughter's face."
PupSocks,2021-01-11T17:27:27Z,2,"The socks look amazing, but aren't well designed. They have a weird shape for socks and aren't confortable to wear. I bought them for my partner and we both tried them and had the same issue with the design."
PupSocks,2021-01-11T17:23:34Z,1,these socks are awful!!!!!  the material is cheap and the sock fit is weird.  they are square at the toes and are very uncomfortable.  Not to mention they were expensive!!!  so disappointed!!!!  will NEVER purchase again or recommend!!!!!!
PupSocks,2021-01-11T17:21:26Z,5,"I purchased Pup Socks for my sons Christmas present and HE LOVED them The picture transfer was very clear, the socks are a decent size and quality Very Happy with this purchase"
PupSocks,2021-01-11T17:21:21Z,1,"Socks are really cheap, thin and uncomfortable. Cute novelty, but don't plan on EVER wearing them."
PupSocks,2021-01-11T17:21:06Z,1,"I placed my order on 11/30/20 and have not received my product.These were to be Christmas gifts for my family.I understand the mail and delivery service has been affected this season, but I have not received any sort of communication to fix this matter.Very disappointing!"
PupSocks,2021-01-11T17:19:45Z,5,"Ordered a pair of socks for my husband for Christmas. A little gift with BIG meaning. We miss our little Puggle - if a dog could light up a room and be the life of a party, it was Joey. So when my husband open the gift, he lit up and got a good laugh. The socks totally capture the essence of Joey's fun-loving, center of attention personality. On the practical side, the material is soft and the fit is great."
PupSocks,2021-01-11T17:19:32Z,1,"My socks were delivered two weeks late, arrived after Christmas and didn’t even have the right dog on them! I’ve emailed twice and still haven’t heard back. Incredibly disappointed. This company is a joke."
PupSocks,2021-01-11T17:18:30Z,2,Late delivery
PupSocks,2021-01-11T17:17:33Z,3,"I have ordered twice from pupsocks. The quality is pretty good and both gift recipients have been happy. These aren't ""normal sock"" material so that's just something to be aware of, because of the way the images are printed on the socks they are a unique material and look. Unfortunately both orders have had issues, on my first order I never got the package and a replacement had to be shipped and on my 2nd order I first received a pair of socks with someone else's dog on them before receiving my correct order."
PupSocks,2021-01-11T17:15:38Z,1,My order was placed on 11/29/2020 and I still have not received my product.  I have reached out to the company multiple times.  They sent me a pair of someone other dog but not Bernie.  I requested a refund and have not received that either.
PupSocks,2021-01-11T17:12:41Z,4,My grandson loved his socks.  I only wish they came in smaller sizes to fit him.  He is six and will have to grow into them.
PupSocks,2021-01-11T17:12:34Z,4,"Product is solid, but shipping time was very slow. I know this might be a result of the pandemic, but it is worth noting."
PupSocks,2021-01-11T17:12:18Z,3,These socks were very cute!  They were able to get both my dogs pictures onto the sock and they looked really cute.  The comfort of the sock is not what I would like it to be.  The material is not soft and the fit is off.  They are cute but not very comfortable.
PupSocks,2021-01-11T17:07:58Z,1,"I ordered a pair of socks well in advance for Christmas.  Socks arrived right before the 25th and there was a different pup on the socks.  I sent a complaint....no response for weeks.  After some time, they asked for me to send a pic of the mystery pup on the socks so they could investigate.  No update yet...and it was been weeks.  The socks weren't cheap...waiting to get my money back.  Would not recommend this company."
PupSocks,2021-01-11T17:06:27Z,1,"I'm sure these socks will be a well received Christmas gift for 2021, if they ever arrive that is! Automated responses with no follow up when I email for information or refund. At this point I worry that this company is more like Wish than a more legitimate business. Wouldn't recommend to a friend at this point but hopefully someone answers my email, since they just this morning prompted me to ""rate my purchase"". Would love to. Can I have it first?"
PupSocks,2021-01-11T17:05:52Z,5,I bought socks and a mask as Christmas gifts and they were a hit! The quality is great and the images were very clear.
PupSocks,2021-01-11T17:05:20Z,2,The socks are just bad quality fabric.
PupSocks,2021-01-11T17:05:19Z,1,Never received my order
PupSocks,2021-01-11T17:04:49Z,5,The quality was much higher than I expected!  Love that you can put more than one face on the socks and it’s the same price.
PupSocks,2021-01-11T17:04:42Z,1,Still waiting for socks ordered mid December. Family didn’t get them for Christmas.  Terrible service
PupSocks,2021-01-11T17:02:59Z,2,Face mask was overpriced and very poor quality.
PupSocks,2021-01-11T17:02:36Z,1,"Ordered on 11/30/20. Still haven’t received. My emails to the company are not responded to. I get an automatic response stating that the postal service is slow and they have thousands of emails to go through. I did receive a picture of the product which I could print to give to the person I ordered the product for. So to recap. After about a month and a half, haven’t received the product and can’t get ahold of anyone at the company."
PupSocks,2021-01-11T17:02:14Z,5,Purchased socks for my husband that included the faces of our two cats. I had low expectations for how they would turn out given the quality of the photo I had provided but they actually turned out amazing! Took about 2 1/2 weeks for them to arrive but that wasn’t surprising given they are a customized product and I ordered them during this past holiday season when shipping companies were inundated.
PupSocks,2021-01-11T17:02:09Z,1,I have not received my order!!!
PupSocks,2021-01-11T17:00:03Z,2,"I went with PupSocks (instead of other companies that do this) because they advertise that you get to see a mockup of your order before printing. Instead, I received the mockup the day after the socks were already delivered! There were two mistakes made on the print. I received them the day before Christmas and had ordered them at the end of November. They were purchased for a Christmas gift so what could I do at that point? I tried following up with them twice, over e-mail and their website chat which says they'll e-mail you back and I never heard back from them."
PupSocks,2021-01-11T16:59:39Z,1,Still haven’t received order - well over 45 days.
PupSocks,2021-01-11T16:59:11Z,5,They are super cute. The quality of the socks are really nice.
PupSocks,2021-01-11T16:58:15Z,2,It did take a full 3 weeks from ordering to shipping. What USPS did after that was not pupsocks fault (took another 3 weeks to deliver). The cheap quality of the socks and masks are pupsocks fault and I do not recommend them. The picture is transferred perfectly and that part is adorable and that's why I'm giving 2 stars instead of 1. These are way overpriced for the material quality of sock or mask that you get.
PupSocks,2021-01-11T16:57:32Z,1,"Order was guaranteed to arrive before Christmas and didn’t arrive in time. Your canned email ensuring that my concerns would be addressed was never followed up on. I understand that it has been a crazy year, but you should have been aware of the logistical difficulties and avoided guaranteeing something that you can’t control."
PupSocks,2021-01-11T16:56:33Z,3,I don't like the fit of the socks though they look ok.
PupSocks,2021-01-11T16:55:39Z,2,Ordered in November for a Christmas present. It’s January 11th and it still hasn’t even shipped yet. 🥲
PupSocks,2021-01-11T16:54:55Z,1,"6 weeks later, still have not received our order. They are good at marketing with almost daily emails, but not at actually delivering the product. Starting to believe it's a scam and that I've lost my money..."
PupSocks,2021-01-11T16:53:56Z,5,"Great job, my daughter loved them. I loved the quality of the socks."
PupSocks,2021-01-11T16:52:02Z,1,"Ordered socks on November 30, Didn't receive until January 8th.  No offer of discount or anything to rectify the situation.  Clearly over committed during the holidays.  Wont order again, several companies out there that do the same thing for less.  Beware"
PupSocks,2021-01-11T16:51:57Z,3,"Unfortunately, I still have not received items I purchased in the beginning of December for Christmas gifts."
PupSocks,2021-01-11T16:51:42Z,5,"These socks are ABSOLUTELY ADORABLE!!! They are also high quality, being both thick and soft. We were ELATED with the look & they definitely brought smiles to our faces!!! I purchased these for my son, who is in an executive level position, but always makes a statement with his socks under his business suits. They are a PERFECT addition to his wardrobe!!! 🐾💙🐾"
PupSocks,2021-01-11T16:51:23Z,1,Socks are mediocre quality and they took 7 weeks to get to my house ...... missed Christmas by 2 weeks ....
PupSocks,2021-01-11T16:50:46Z,1,I ordered one pair of socks end of November and this is January 11 and still have not received the socks - which were a christmas gift.I cannot get anyone to respond to my last emails asking about the product.
PupSocks,2021-01-11T16:48:36Z,2,Haven't received the socks yet... BUT the picture of the final product to give to my friend at Christmas was a great touch!!! Just hopefully they get here soon Thanks
PupSocks,2021-01-11T16:48:26Z,3,I still haven’t received my socks that were shipped beginning of December.😞
PupSocks,2021-01-11T16:47:28Z,1,Very VERY SLOW! Took well over a month to receive order. I was a gift and did not arrive in time for the celebration. I reached out to the company and got ZERO response. Take your money and run. Wasn't impressed with quality of product once I actually received it.
PupSocks,2021-01-11T16:45:56Z,3,Overall a fun gift idea. The picture of our dog looked faded on the product and our dog is very scruffy but when the photo is edited it makes solid lines and takes away from his actual appearance. A fun one time purchase.
PupSocks,2021-01-11T16:45:46Z,5,Person gifted loved the end result!
PupSocks,2021-01-11T16:43:41Z,1,"Ordered the socks on November 30, and did not get them until early January.The pet picture worked out fine, but the quality of the socks was really bad. They fit very tight around the ankle, and aren’t formed like a sock.  They are basically straight tubes.I would never purchase these again. It was a waste of money."
PupSocks,2021-01-11T16:43:21Z,1,I ordered a pair of socks as a gift and over a month later I received a mask with someone else’s dog on it. Tried to contact customer service and they are still not responding after a couple of weeks. Not happy at all. Would like a refund but customer service won’t reply. Do not recommend ordering from this company.
PupSocks,2021-01-11T16:42:03Z,2,"The socks I received (with pictures of my CAT) were filled with dog bones. I was not able to see that when I ordered. Also, the socks are not high quality. I was disappointed. Not to mention they took forever to arrive."
PupSocks,2021-01-11T16:41:28Z,1,"Still haven't received my correct order yet. If my assumption is correct that this is a drop shipping company, than this is the worst managed one I've seen. Should've bought this straight from AliExpress myself for $5.22. Anybody can build a drop shipping company and it shows. For anyone reading this, just go to Aliexpress.com and you can buy this exact product for ~$6 instead of $40."
PupSocks,2021-01-11T16:40:56Z,4,The socks look really cute but both my kids have said they are uncomfortable and a weird material.  I would agree
PupSocks,2021-01-11T16:40:41Z,1,"Received the wrong pair of sucks. It was to a Christmas gift. I ordered in November. I didn't even receive a reply from them until 1/11/21 (when I notified Pay Pal). I likely wouldn't even have heard from them, if I didn't dispute payment.  I can't say I have much faith in them."
PupSocks,2021-01-11T16:40:30Z,5,Great product. Turned out perfect.
PupSocks,2021-01-11T16:39:35Z,1,"After waiting 4 weeks for delivery we received the wrong product.  Not only was it the wrong product, the inside packaging (holding the blanket) had worms in it. I emailed customer service on 12/29 amd never received a response."
PupSocks,2021-01-11T16:39:25Z,1,I have NOY received my order!How do I get a refund?
PupSocks,2021-01-11T16:39:08Z,5,Great socks! Easy transaction and awesome picture of my beloved dogs!
PupSocks,2021-01-11T16:38:14Z,1,"I put a 3 sock order in from Canada, on November 30th, and still HAVE NOT gotten my order. I’m not happy about it. You have already taken my money, but still haven’t received my order. It looks like my order landed in Canada on Jan 6, but still nothing. My order #2460056. Can someone look into this please and thank you! Kristen C"
PupSocks,2021-01-11T16:38:08Z,1,"I keep getting emails about reminding me to review my product/order.. Except that I made my order very early on November the 30th 2020, today is January the 11th and I STILL haven’t received anything or any sort of an update on where on the planet what was supposed to be a Christmas gift, is exactly. Was really excited about this, because I loved the idea of also donating to animals and making more future orders. But it has been more than 25 business days and still nothing unfortunately. No real comms from the company either, despite multiple attempts so far. I’m trying to be patient, but.. It’s a week into the new year and I haven’t really heard anything at all about my order."
PupSocks,2021-01-11T16:37:01Z,5,"Ordered a pair of socks as a gift, it was well received"
PupSocks,2021-01-11T16:35:37Z,1,The socks had cat emoji pictographs - when I ordered dog ones. The socks size is giant - I didn’t realize there was only one size. You should have child sizes . The order took over 6 weeks . Not worth the money spent
PupSocks,2021-01-11T16:35:03Z,4,"I was excited to be able to purchase this my loves. The only issues I had was with the shipping timeframe. USPS is slow, so when you purchase expect the product to arrive much later than expected. Purchased in November and the socks didn't arrive until January. Other than that, this was an excellent experience and my loves adored the socks. Thanks!"
PupSocks,2021-01-11T16:32:44Z,1,"Here is the situation:ordered on November 30tracking # created December 18 (why the delay?)USPS status is ""In transit"" since December 24Today is Jan 11 :-( and no socksI have emailed Support 2x and no response."
PupSocks,2021-01-11T16:32:31Z,1,It has taken more than a month for my socks to come in. They still haven’t come and I was wanting to have them for Christmas to give to my mom and aunt. Now they’re coming too late and still haven’t arrived.
PupSocks,2021-01-11T16:31:30Z,1,"I ordered a pair of socks on November 30th. Today January 11th, I still have not received my order !!!"
PupSocks,2021-01-11T16:30:53Z,3,The look of these socks is great.The feel/texture and fit is awful.They feel greasy/slimy and the fit is weird.  Not comfortable at all.It’s a great concept but you need to find better quality socks.
PupSocks,2021-01-11T16:28:48Z,1,"It's hard to give a review on a product I haven't received!  I ordered these in November as a Christmas gift and as of January 11th, still have not received them or any information regarding there whereabouts.  I received a notice that they were in production ... but that's it."
PupSocks,2021-01-11T16:27:38Z,1,"I would love to review the socks I ordered in November, but they haven't arrived yet."
PupSocks,2021-01-11T16:27:23Z,5,The company really helped me get my order when I was having a problem with shipping due to USPS being so backed up.
PupSocks,2021-01-11T16:27:00Z,1,I never got my order. Still waiting. Got a pair of socks with a random dog on them I guess to pacify me while I wait. Still waiting.
PupSocks,2021-01-11T16:26:49Z,1,"I placed my order for pup socks on November 30th, hoping to have them as a gift for my friend’s birthday in mid December.  I received a notification that they were shipped on December 8th, but didn’t receive them until December 29th. The pupsocks I received were for someone else’s order. After emailing customer service I have yet to hear back from anyone."
PupSocks,2021-01-11T16:24:29Z,3,"The end product was great!  However, the process to get there was a little bumpy.  I ordered the socks in plenty of time to receive them for Christmas and was given an expected arrival date for my order.  The socks arrived several days later, after Christmas, and thus had to be mailed separately from the rest of the gifts to the person I was gifting them to.  What frustrated me the most was I tried contacting the company through a few different avenues just to get an update on the shipping/arrival date and didn't receive ONE response.  Pretty disappointed."
PupSocks,2021-01-11T16:24:08Z,1,"I recieved a wrong order, send an e-mail last week and still no reply or solution. I'm expecting a refund, it was supposed to be a christmas gift, it got here late and its not what I ordered. Its very upsetting."
PupSocks,2021-01-11T16:22:59Z,3,"These socks are SO cute!! The image is amazing and great quality, the socks however, are not as high quality. They’re shaped like a box in the toe area, and a weird material. Appearance is 100/10, but the fit doesn’t match up:("
PupSocks,2021-01-11T16:22:08Z,5,Ordered the new blanket. It turned out great and is super soft.  Will be getting an additional one for a friend
PupSocks,2021-01-11T16:19:30Z,1,Still have not received it and still not reply from customer service
PupSocks,2021-01-11T16:18:58Z,1,I don't have received the socks and I would like to be refund please
PupSocks,2021-01-11T16:18:05Z,3,"I ordered two pairs of socks, one each for the picture of the dogs I sent. Got both pairs but they were identical, both featuring the same dog.They're still good socks, but one puppy is very miffed."
PupSocks,2021-01-11T16:16:30Z,1,I ordered my socks the first week of December.  They were a gift for Christmas.  Still have not received them.  No shipping options. Very poor communication.   Will not order anything from this company again.
PupSocks,2021-01-11T16:16:22Z,1,I still have not receive my product after emails I sent
PupSocks,2021-01-11T16:16:08Z,5,The first order was great. The second order does not look anything like my cat. I was very unhappy but they were swamped with orders. They have since gotten in touch and offered to remake or refund and are communicating. They truly are trying to make amends.
PupSocks,2021-01-11T16:09:05Z,3,"Purchased multiple pairs of socks with pet photos on them.  Service and photos were/are outstanding but quality and fit of socks is really poor.  Obviously these are not meant to be “everyday” socks but wish they had a least some decent fit to them. Overall, I would buy from this company again but I don’t recommend the socks based on their uncomfortable fit and poor design quality.  If you want your personalized pet picture go with a blanket instead of the socks!"
PupSocks,2021-01-11T16:08:16Z,1,I did not receive the correct order and have been ghosted by customer service. I am out of money because I can't return the item since I can not get in contact with anyone from the company.
PupSocks,2021-01-11T16:06:29Z,1,"I ordered two pairs of socks on December 5th and received a confirmation that my order [order #2492689] was received that same day. You also charged my credit card on December 5th.  On December 11th I received notice that my order has shipped [Globegistics trachink number #LX733444434US].  Today is January 11th and I have still not received the socks. Even more disturbing is that the shipping tracking site still shows no change in status, after one month! I do understand shipping delays due to COVID-19, but all of the other items I have ordered from the USA for Christmas have arrived, including Amazon, NFL websites and College sports store websites. Surely, the package from PupSocks has progressed beyond status ""Shipping Information Received"" in 30 days?"
PupSocks,2021-01-11T16:04:45Z,5,Got these for Christmas for a friend. I was able to include both of her pups. They turned out so great and she loved them!
PupSocks,2021-01-11T16:03:44Z,1,Never received items and never received answers to my multiple contact attempts.
PupSocks,2021-01-11T15:58:42Z,2,The printing turned out fine but the socks themselves are terrible. They are flat and ill-fitting and sized too large. The youth socks fit me as an adult. I would not buy these again.
PupSocks,2021-01-11T15:48:41Z,2,"We ordered this blanket beginning of November, it was supposed to be here before Christmas, it did not get here on time. When we open the blanket it looks like there's a big tare in it. It was not a tare,  It is a big crease from where It got stuck in the printer I am assuming. The crease is right over one of my dogs faces so it's really noticeable. I would of thought you guys check the final results before shipping it out. I'm a business owner myself and I make sure that everything I do is to perfection before I say I'm done."
PupSocks,2021-01-11T15:47:22Z,5,My in-laws were thrilled with their pupsocks!
PupSocks,2021-01-11T15:44:58Z,3,"Still waiting to see the quality of these socks.  Make sure you order before Easter if you expect them for Christmas.  🥴Placed my order for 3 pairs near the end of November, and am still waiting, 2 weeks into January."
PupSocks,2021-01-11T15:30:25Z,3,"The socks turned out cute and my daughter loves them. The only complaint I have is the socks are cheap quality. The price is expensive and I know it’s because they are custom made; however, I would have liked a better quality sock. These socks are thin and rough, not soft at all.  I gave three stars because they are super cute"
PupSocks,2021-01-11T15:28:15Z,5,"LOVE the PupSocks!  Bought a pair for everyone in our family, all different colors.  So fun and a great gift."
PupSocks,2021-01-11T15:26:22Z,2,The socks came in a little later than expected.  The biggest issue is that my daughter who I got these for cannot wear them as the socks do not fit like normal socks. Very disappointing!
PupSocks,2021-01-11T15:26:01Z,1,"I ordered the blanket for a Christmas present and when it came, it did not have my dog on it.  I contacted the company requesting it to be corrected on 12/26/2020. I received an auto reply response back acknowledging they received my message but have not yet been contacted back by the company to correct the mistake."
PupSocks,2021-01-11T15:06:39Z,5,This is an amazing gift for any pet lover in your life! My family loved them - best present ever.
PupSocks,2021-01-11T15:06:07Z,1,I placed my order over a month ago and still haven’t received them.
PupSocks,2021-01-11T15:05:14Z,5,"Love the blanket and the mask, they turned out beautifully. I know it was a busy time of year and that shipping was delayed for everyone around the holidays, so I definitely won't hold that against. you."
PupSocks,2021-01-11T14:59:44Z,1,"This company really needs to work on its customer service.    My Daughter’s Christmas present arrived after Christmas.  I understand that this was a problem with the post office. But then when I did receive, it was the wrong item. It doesn’t even have a picture of my dog on it. Instead I have pictures of some cats on it. I have tried emailing them several times but keep getting a stupid form email back about how they’re having problems with the post office. This does not address my issue of how to get my daughter her Christmas present. It is now three weeks after Christmas and I still have not received any information about how to get my correct product. There is no phone number to call where you can talk to someone, it is strictly sent through emails. And apparently nobody checks any of their emails. I spent $25 on a pair of socks and I expect good service and to receive the correct product."
PupSocks,2021-01-11T14:56:38Z,4,"I ordered a pair for my parter for Christmas, and the sock prints were great. Sock style was slightly different thank expected, but good quality along with the images. But could your packaging be any more conspicuous!? Kinda ruined the surprise of my gift by screaming to the world about what was inside. I get that you’re making sure your brand packaging is cute, but maybe y’all should have a ‘gift’ check box so you’re not ruining the surprise with your packaging. 😒 Really took the wind outa my sails with that one.."
PupSocks,2021-01-11T14:39:25Z,1,I received the wrong order and haven’t heard back from customer service yet.
PupSocks,2021-01-11T14:35:05Z,5,I picked it out for my boyfriends family with their dog's face on as a reminder and joy that will never be forgotten (she passed away less than a year ago) and they all absolutely loved it especially his dad who almost teared up in joy. Totally recommend for any pet owner with love!
PupSocks,2021-01-11T14:30:41Z,5,"Wow! Perfect holiday gifts! My teenagers loved the large, comfy blankets on which their beloved dogs' faces were plastered!  Higher quality blanket than I had expected.  Soft, cozy, big.  These gifts were the hit of Christmas.  Also, the PupSocks folks were kind enough to cut out a silhouette of my dog's body to add to a pair of socks for one of my kids.  She loved it!  I wasn't sure if PupSocks only did faces but I added the request in the comments when I ordered and PupSocks came through! I've already recommended you to many inquiring family members and friends.  tThanks so much!"
PupSocks,2021-01-11T14:29:34Z,2,"Hi,  I ordered my sock at the beginning of November and I still haven't received them. I try writing you about it and i never had a response.  I would like to know where is my package!"
PupSocks,2021-01-11T14:26:53Z,5,The socks were perfect and my nephew loves them!
PupSocks,2021-01-11T14:14:57Z,4,The pictures on the socks were really cute. However the socks were a weird material. The socks were more nylon and not a regular sock. My boys didn't think they were very comfortable.
PupSocks,2021-01-11T14:09:47Z,5,The socks and the mask I ordered turned out perfect. A+++++
PupSocks,2021-01-11T13:55:54Z,5,Great product! Actually bought them as a gift and in return my wife gave me a pair:) we love the pictures and I’ve already received compliments.
PupSocks,2021-01-11T13:53:34Z,4,"The pictures are clear and exactly the look we anticipated. The socks do seem a bit thin, but still happy with how they turned out overall."
PupSocks,2021-01-11T13:50:03Z,1,I never received my order. I sent 2 emails trying to obtain an update and never heard back. This is horrible customer service.
PupSocks,2021-01-11T13:42:35Z,2,I lost knowledge of where my package was and tried to contact the company with no response O only received the package my chanse
PupSocks,2021-01-11T13:19:30Z,1,The socks were late... The quality of the mask is terrible and small. The socks are generic one size fits all. They didn’t cut out the face well of the pics I sent.
PupSocks,2021-01-11T13:14:40Z,2,"Placed my order on 11/27/20 for 3 items in the amount of $85.20 (2 masks, 1 blanket.) Received a notification on 12/9/20 that the order had shipped but there was no other activity on the USPS tracking than “a label was created”. Started seeing comments on their Facebook page from other customers with the same concern including no response from PupSocks other than generic customer service emails. Finally after Christmas PupSocks sent emails with “mock ups” of your order so you could show the gift recipient what would be coming. Really? Apparently this is a thing with them as people posted older BBB complaints all with the same common thread. Interestingly enough, after that, the USPS “label created” status changed and packages began to ship. Mine arrived on Jan 6th. I do have to say, the 2 masks and large blanket I ordered were very well done and I was satisfied. However, I will most likely not use this company again nor do I recommend them until they get their act together.  They only got a second star because my order arrived, was done correctly and I was happy with the quality."
PupSocks,2021-01-11T13:00:00Z,1,Incredibly long shipping.
PupSocks,2021-01-11T12:12:11Z,5,Got a pair of socks for my daughter as a Christmas gift. She absolutely loved it!
PupSocks,2021-01-11T12:11:47Z,1,I never did receive my order.
PupSocks,2021-01-11T11:52:07Z,5,"Pup socks are so cute! I give them as gifts, & they are always a hit! They make PERFECT stocking stuffers @ Christmas time, too!  My husband loves his, & wears them to work with a suit!"
PupSocks,2021-01-11T11:27:22Z,1,These socks aren’t even wearable. The material is horrible
PupSocks,2021-01-11T10:47:11Z,1,"After 7 weeks of asking, I received my order.  The blanket was soft, very nice.  I ordered two pairs of socks, terrible quality. They aren’t really socks, just a giant tube with pics on them, not wearable.  The two people I gave them to (3 weeks after Christmas as a gift) laughed and tried them on, but def not wearable.  I like the blanket, but I would never purchase from this company again due to shipping issues which they blamed on USPS (although I received all other shipments fine) and the socks are awful."
PupSocks,2021-01-11T10:39:25Z,1,Waited over 6 weeks for the socks to arrive. They are uncomfortable and were too small. Very disappointing and would not recommend or order again.
PupSocks,2021-01-11T08:33:10Z,1,I have yet to receive my order and it’s been two months. Can’t give a good rating when I don’t have my product?
PupSocks,2021-01-11T07:46:57Z,4,"This was a fun gift with no purpose but to bring smiles. Mission accomplished!The printing on the socks was great. Detailed & well done. Unfortunately, they are shaped like tube socks, with no heel knitted into the socks. My adult daughter says they don't fit well. I grew up wearing tube socks during sports, & I had no problem. I don't know how they held up after washing."
PupSocks,2021-01-11T07:35:00Z,1,"I placed my order on November 29 2020 and still have not received confirmation of delivery at destination. I did not get a chance to review proofs before placing the order; The production of the order was delayed; then once it was was shipped the tracking information has never been updated. I understand Covid causes delays, and that post office was busy during holidays—- that was not the issue here. They weren’t able to handle the volume of orders and so they were not able to provide a quality customer experience. I am very disappointed, would not recommend. You can have photos printed on socks or masks elsewhere."
PupSocks,2021-01-11T06:00:06Z,4,Great gift for pet lovers! Picture looked great and brought a smile to the recipient's faces!
PupSocks,2021-01-11T05:59:43Z,3,"I absolutely loved having the image of my sons dog put on a pair of socks for him. It’s such a fun idea!Placing the order was an easy process and the socks were produced and arrived in a very timely manner.I gave the socks to my son and they now hang proudly on his wall by his bed because the size, shape, material and fit of the socks make them unwearable.They’re made of some sort of plastic like fabric the stretches lengthwise- making them too long (he wears a men’s size 11) and too tight. Great concept, not so great final product, sadly."
PupSocks,2021-01-11T05:14:41Z,3,"Great service, the delivery did not take too long (considering holidays and the fact it is customized). The socks though... Are not wearable. They're very very cute, but the material is horrible, not flexible, very thick, totally uncomfortable. The shape is very awkward too. My husband couldn't even put them on. It became a ""souvenir sock""."
PupSocks,2021-01-11T04:57:11Z,1,"Took 6 weeks to deliver. Not happy, I contacted them for help or a partial refund with zero response. I don't recommend."
PupSocks,2021-01-11T04:54:32Z,1,Still haven’t received my order that I placed on Nov. 29. I have sent numerous emails. I did get a response back just before Christmas stating orders have been delayed and that they are experiencing shipping issues. It’s been a month and a half and after more emails with no reply. I have little hope of seeing my order and at this point an wondering what it will take to get a refund.
PupSocks,2021-01-11T04:38:18Z,1,The product took a month and a half to arrive. I ordered the masks as Christmas gifts on 11/26/2020 and they arrived the first week of January.The masks are poor quality and are very small on me and I typically have to order small masks. I am very dissatisfied with the quality of the masks for the price of $25 each.
PupSocks,2021-01-11T03:55:22Z,5,I gave the pup socks as a gift for Christmas and my friend literally cried because she loved them so much! The pictures of her two Doberman dogs were detailed and perfect!
PupSocks,2021-01-11T03:23:58Z,1,Did not receive
PupSocks,2021-01-11T03:21:54Z,5,My mother in law LOVED her mask and said that it is super comfortable. The picture of her dog came out perfectly.
PupSocks,2021-01-11T03:12:25Z,1,"6 weeks and haven’t seen my order and NO RESPONSE from the company. Dishonest company, no way i will purchase from them again."
PupSocks,2021-01-11T02:58:17Z,3,"The socks are adorable with the pet images but they have a really strange shape and fit kinda weird, making your feet look like paddles.  But...  they are a cute novelty gift."
PupSocks,2021-01-11T02:54:57Z,1,"Unfortunately, I have had a negative experience with PupSocks. The delivery I placed on Nov. 28 has yet to arrive and I was unable to give the socks as a Christmas gift as I had planned. I have received no information from them as to the status of my order."
PupSocks,2021-01-11T02:53:56Z,1,Order placed Nov 29 and still have not received as of January 10th. I have not received any information on when/if the order will be shipped.
PupSocks,2021-01-11T02:27:31Z,2,the quality was good but it took forever to get here. i ordered it november 26th figuring that it would get here way before christmas but it didn’t get here till december 30th. i had no idea where it was for 2 weeks straight. i had no way to get ahold of the support staff
PupSocks,2021-01-11T02:19:36Z,2,"I really hate to leave a bad review but despite multiple attempts to be in touch with the company about the issue, I haven't had any replies.  I ordered a personalized mask.  I received the mask and the print looks great, no complaints at all about that!!  The problem is that the adjusters that are supposed to be on the straps don't come on the straps when you order so you have to put them on yourself.  That's the problem. The one end is a teeny hole, impossible to get the strap through.  Maybe there's a trick to it but nobody has returned my emails to find out.  So our mask is sitting unused as the straps need to be adjustable (it falls off otherwise and I have a normal sized face).  I'd love to have a response and get this resolved and be able to change this to a positive review."
PupSocks,2021-01-11T02:12:54Z,1,"Ordered at the end of November and still have not received the socks. USPS status says a label was created on 12/9, but nothing after that date. I wish I had done my research before ordering. Lots of complaints about poor service and quality. Our local community page even discussed how no one had received their order either. Buyer beware."
PupSocks,2021-01-11T01:14:37Z,1,"This could so easily have been a five-star review. I ordered two blankets and received one, which is fantastic. But the second blanket sent to me had someone else's dog on it and I have yet to receive my missing item.I've emailed PupSocks three times now. Only one email was answered, and I provided the requested photos within moments of receipt. Since then, there's been only radio silence.Great product, not great order fulfillment... and terrible customer service."
PupSocks,2021-01-11T00:55:45Z,4,"My over all review is great although 3 weeks late for Christmas , I’m going to take into account all the extra Carrier companies and mall delivery was over whelmed by the pandemic. Pup socks did however send me an e-gift that I could and did forward to the lucky recipients. Once the gifts arrived I noticed how lifelike they are and comfortable the wear lol . I highly recommend pupsocks as a gift ."
PupSocks,2021-01-11T00:54:10Z,1,I orders socks and they were shipped but my envelope was opened in transit and the package was delivered empty.   I have no way to contact the company other than emails.  I sent four emails and never received a response.  I have no idea if they will sending me a new pair of socks.   I am sad at how poor the customer service is and how hard it is to get a response.
PupSocks,2021-01-11T00:48:59Z,5,Super cute item! My mom loved to get socks with her dog's pic on them :)
PupSocks,2021-01-11T00:46:08Z,2,"I ordered 8 pairs of socks for our family (6 adults & 2 children) and only two pair fit; one adult and one child. Everyone liked the idea of having our pets pictures on the socks, but they’re not practical to be worn and shared with others. Very disappointed for the money spent on these socks!!!"
PupSocks,2021-01-11T00:42:10Z,1,Ordered November 29th. Notified the socks were done and shipping December 8.   Still says usps tracking “awaiting pick up”.  I’ve emailed several times but get an auto response blaming usps.  I received every other item I ordered with no issues from any carrier.  Disputing the charge on Monday.
PupSocks,2021-01-11T00:38:44Z,1,"I put specific instructions of what to include on the socks and when I get the mock up, because my order was going to be extremely late, I found out they had cut out the graduation hat I’ve asked to Include. I would have sent a new photo if I knew that would not be included. The final product had half of my dogs head cut off because the hat was covering it but the hat was never included. I spent $100 on the socks and I didnt even know what they would look like until they were made and they were not what I expected. These were gifts that I’m very disappointed in"
PupSocks,2021-01-11T00:21:05Z,2,"I loved the print, but what very disappointed in the material the socks were made of.  They are unwearable."
PupSocks,2021-01-11T00:01:50Z,3,Displeased with overall quality and fit
PupSocks,2021-01-11T00:01:09Z,1,Got the wrong socks and there is no response from this company. Horrible customer service.
PupSocks,2021-01-11T00:00:56Z,3,"Sock are tube socks so they don’t curve at your ankle. This makes them rather uncomfortable. They are a thin slippery material that also does not make them very comfy. When you put them in they look different too because the stretch and crease because there is no curve for the ankle. They are just ok, good idea but the execution makes them nothing special and wouldn’t get again for this price/quality."
PupSocks,2021-01-10T23:54:31Z,5,omg  best gift ever  everyone now wants a pair of socks with sweet dolly
PupSocks,2021-01-10T23:54:18Z,5,I purchased the socks as a Christmas gift for my wife The picture on the socks was of our Beagle Eddie who sadly passed away The quality of the photo was excellent and my wife loves them
PupSocks,2021-01-10T23:21:39Z,2,"My order shipped two weeks later than expected, without any interim updates, and then it was missing an item. My outreach to request a refund for the missing item has gone unanswered. I do like the items I received but they came more than a week after Christmas, forcing me to purchase other gifts for the holiday."
PupSocks,2021-01-10T23:13:14Z,2,Unfortunately as of today I cannot provide a review as I still have yet to receive my order that was placed on November 29th.Understand the delay in shipping but this is much longer than I expected. It was a Christmas gift and the company did send and email with a card to apologize and A preview of what the socks looked liked so at least I was able to give her that.
PupSocks,2021-01-10T23:11:35Z,1,I got the wrong order
PupSocks,2021-01-10T23:10:21Z,5,"I ordered pup socks for everyone I know this christmas, and a couple masks. They were a hit! Everyone LOVES Them. thank you for making an easy christmas gift, that look great and are high quality!"
PupSocks,2021-01-10T23:03:27Z,5,"My brother loves his PupSocks gift!! I saw their ad on Instagram and knew that these would be perfect for him. Submitting the photo with my order was super easy, I was able to do it seamlessly from my phone. I was worried about my order getting here on time because of how chaotic this holiday season was for USPS. I sent an email and got a heartfelt response about everything PupSocks was doing to make sure their orders were going out on time. Fortunately, the socks were delivered right on time and I was delighted! The socks were very high quality and the photo turned out really well and was perfectly cropped. Highly recommend PupSocks!"
PupSocks,2021-01-10T23:03:01Z,1,Save your money! I ordered the beginning of December and didn’t get my order until after Christmas. As an apology they sent me a credit for a pair of socks but it didn’t work. I emailed them and finally they sent another and that didn’t work. Finally I just gave up. Not worth the hassle. This company doesn’t know anything about customer service because the response time is long.👿 Save your money and find another company to buy your products. 👎
PupSocks,2021-01-10T23:00:34Z,1,I still havent got my order after 2 months
PupSocks,2021-01-10T23:00:05Z,2,Took over a month to receive and disappointed with material.
PupSocks,2021-01-10T22:41:27Z,5,Very pleased with how these socks came out! Clear print of our cat’s face on pretty comfy socks. Would recommend.
PupSocks,2021-01-10T22:34:27Z,5,"Very cute socks!  Material was a little heavier than I thought it would be, but everyone loved them. Shipping took longer than expected, but that could have been due to the Covid-19 delays."
PupSocks,2021-01-10T22:28:13Z,1,Ordered on November 29 and as of thr 10th of January still do not have my order.  This company is a waste of money.
PupSocks,2021-01-10T22:26:26Z,1,"I ordered socks online on November 29, '20.  They were guaranteed to arrive withing 15 business days.  They arrived on January 6, '21, by which time I had purchased an alternate gift for my daughter, contacted the ""team"" three times (each time I was ignored), tried to ""track"" my parcel (the tracking mechanism didn't work), contacted my credit card to dispute the charge for the socks (and spent over an hour on hold to do so).  I am NOT impressed.  My daughter loves the socks, but I will NEVER order from this company again."
PupSocks,2021-01-10T21:56:44Z,5,Best gift ever it turned out just how I had hoped and was super soft!
PupSocks,2021-01-10T21:55:16Z,2,"I placed my order before end of November and it arrived only in the 2nd week of January.Production took a while to start but delivery was horrible with the chosen carrier. All companies face issues with COVID-19, but no other orders from different companies with different carriers took so long."
PupSocks,2021-01-10T21:54:58Z,1,"Placed an order and receive email stating my order was in production, never received the order and checked status.  It said I needed to upload photo.  How was the order in production without the photo?  After numerous attempts to rectify the upload, I cancelled the order.   I was charged a cancellation fee for an order that was never produced."
PupSocks,2021-01-10T21:52:13Z,5,"We love the blanket!  Great likeness of our dog!!  And a very cozy, soft blanket!"
PupSocks,2021-01-10T21:48:22Z,3,"Not really wearable!I thought the socks would be softer, cotton material socks.  They are extremely tight and hard to get on.  Bought two pairs, we can't wear them comfortably hope the modify the material they use.  These could be better."
PupSocks,2021-01-10T21:48:01Z,1,"I still do not have the socks I've ordered, nor an update from PupSocks on the delivery status or a refund."
PupSocks,2021-01-10T21:44:20Z,1,"Slow as a snailOrdered in November for Xmas, nothing arrived other than an email with we are sorry your order is later, here is a picture you can use as your gift, how lame is that for a gift??  It's now January - still no sign of my order."
PupSocks,2021-01-10T21:38:16Z,5,"Good quality sock, we put multiple images of our daughter’s cat on it and it was hilarious.  Fun item."
PupSocks,2021-01-10T21:35:37Z,5,The person I bought the socks for absolutely loved them and got the biggest kick out of them. I was extremely happy with how they came out because I wasn't sure how they were going to crop the picture.
PupSocks,2021-01-10T21:25:13Z,1,I have yet to receive what I ordered
PupSocks,2021-01-10T21:19:44Z,1,I didn’t receive the right order and never got contacted back about it
PupSocks,2021-01-10T21:15:23Z,5,PupSocks were an awesome gift!  I ordered a pair for my husband with the face of our sweet 7 month old puppy with the blue background. He was so surprised and happy!  The socks fit well and have held up after a couple of washings. I'm thinking of ordering another pair with a different picture.
PupSocks,2021-01-10T21:14:40Z,1,I ordered pup socks on December 1st with guaranteed delivery by Christmas. It is January 10th and I still DO NOT have my order! This is ridiculous!!
PupSocks,2021-01-10T21:00:19Z,5,Great experience and loved the ending result
PupSocks,2021-01-10T20:54:58Z,1,I ordered pupsocks as a Christmas present and they still haven’t arrived.
PupSocks,2021-01-10T20:50:04Z,5,"Perfect, great quality and picture"
PupSocks,2021-01-10T20:35:49Z,1,We really like the idea but the socks aren’t good quality :(
PupSocks,2021-01-10T20:34:02Z,3,Order was processed too late & received too  late. I ordered right after Thanksgiving & received it in January.
PupSocks,2021-01-10T20:29:10Z,2,Your shipping system is horrible. I order similar products from an other provider on the same day. Delivered 3 weeks earlier. In time for Christmas. Yours came 2 weeks after Christmas. You have lost a future customer by trying to save a buck. No one needs to spend $50 for 2 pairs of socks.  It's a novelty.
PupSocks,2021-01-10T20:22:56Z,2,"The picture of our dog is great, but the actual shape and fit of the socks is TERRIBLE. They are boxy and really almost unwearable. They are not soft either. Disappointed in the inability to wear them although the thought is nice. For the price, I would have expected a better fit."
PupSocks,2021-01-10T20:22:06Z,2,"The prints on the sock were fine. It was just that the sock physically wasn't right. The elastic wasn't on the right side of the sock, and is overall unbearable to wear. So now it's just hanging up on the wall. (Not the intended purpose)"
PupSocks,2021-01-10T20:17:58Z,5,Wonderful gift
PupSocks,2021-01-10T20:04:47Z,3,"Was not fast shipping at all. Came a month after I ordered it. I understood with the holidays and everything that it was delayed immensely, but then I got the masks and one of them has a white strip on the one side of the mask like it wasn’t centered when it was created. It was a gift and it arrived the day before we exchanged gifts so I wasn’t going to send it back. Overall a frustrating process with an average product"
PupSocks,2021-01-10T20:03:44Z,1,"Haven’t received my order, which was placed back in November. Would never use or recommend this company, if it’s actually real."
PupSocks,2021-01-10T20:03:13Z,1,Did not receive correct order and am still waiting for a response back...
PupSocks,2021-01-10T19:47:33Z,2,"The customer service was fantastic but the actual product was not good at all.  The socks are such a weird material, they don't fit.  I got socks for 3 different people and they don't fit any of them.  Extremely disappointed with the product."
PupSocks,2021-01-10T19:34:19Z,1,"We never received our socks 😢. Our kids are so upset-they were supposed to be a Christmas gift. If I could give you zero stars, I would."
PupSocks,2021-01-10T19:25:26Z,5,"These turned out amazing! The image was spot on, my family loved them!"
PupSocks,2021-01-10T19:13:19Z,2,I still haven’t gotten my order that I ordered at the end of November
PupSocks,2021-01-10T19:10:48Z,5,I’ve given these as presents for the past couple of Christmases and everyone has loved them. They are good quality and look great.
PupSocks,2021-01-10T19:06:55Z,3,"I ordered socks as a Christmas gift in November.  The packaging has an easy open perforated bag which, unfortunately, opened somewhere in the shipping process, and I received an empty bag. Since the only way I could find to contact customer service was by email, I did so, but it took 4 or 5 days to get a response. A replacement pair of socks was sent, but it did not come until after the holidays."
PupSocks,2021-01-10T19:04:35Z,1,Socks never arrived Can't say as I paid several weeks ago and never got them.
PupSocks,2021-01-10T19:04:00Z,1,I received the wrong socks and have emailed their customer service twice - no answer!Is this a scam?
PupSocks,2021-01-10T19:03:17Z,1,"Ordered pupsocks on December 11th, did not receive until the second week in January. I paid the extra $7.51 for ""gift packaging"" which was the socks thrown in a typical labeled shipping bag. Socks are fine but beware this company and their so called ""gift packaging."" Seems to be a money gatb as i have contacted the company with no response looking for the $7.51 be refunded. I have sent an email since the first attempts to contact with no response still."
PupSocks,2021-01-10T19:02:43Z,5,They cropped the picture perfectly and the quality of the picture is quite good!  I've never seen this fabric in a sock before - it's interesting.  Nothing negative to say about it or the experience!
PupSocks,2021-01-10T18:59:25Z,1,It STILL hasn't arrived~!
PupSocks,2021-01-10T18:57:42Z,5,These socks were Christmas presents for my kids and they loved them! They look so good. Ordering was easy and shipping was fast. I want to order more
PupSocks,2021-01-10T18:55:42Z,1,I ordered a blanket before Christmas. It arrived in time but was the wrong blanket--as in it had someone else's pets on it. I have emailed 5-6 times and keep getting an automated response about Covid delivery times. I am very frustrated and anxious to get my blanket.
PupSocks,2021-01-10T18:53:43Z,5,Great product!   Even better than expected.
PupSocks,2021-01-10T18:49:36Z,3,"While I appreciate the photo of the socks that were sent to show me the final result, we still have not received our socks.No update since Dec 18.So this review will remain at poor until I have the product in hand. Then I can give an accurate rating."
PupSocks,2021-01-10T18:49:07Z,4,"Fantastic product, a connection with a fur baby close to our hearts. Great gift, didn’t expect material in sock when they finally arrived. After I saw them being worn though they work well as very comfortable and good size."
PupSocks,2021-01-10T18:48:30Z,1,I sent a photo of two dogs and they cropped one out of the photo. This was intended as a Christmas gift and is completely useless. What a waste of money. Buyer beware!
PupSocks,2021-01-10T18:48:20Z,3,"Image turned out really well! However, they were very expensive and they did not arrive in time for Christmas (the order was placed a month before).There was also a loose thread in one of the pairs which made us question the quality."
PupSocks,2021-01-10T18:40:02Z,1,"When will I ever see the socks?!? I ordered 6 pairs of socks for Christmas, way back in mid November. It is almost 2 months and I continue to receive promo codes and advertisements to order new socks without ever having received my order."
PupSocks,2021-01-10T18:39:13Z,5,Love my pup socks. They always do a great job with the pictures and it’s one of my favorite gifts to give!
PupSocks,2021-01-10T18:32:25Z,5,This was a perfect gift for my partner.  He always can have his best friend with him.
PupSocks,2021-01-10T18:27:29Z,1,The reason for the bad review is that the socks came after Christmas were supposed to be here before Christmas and they were the wrong socks not even my dog and not even the right color of socks this is why I gave a bad review and I still have not heard back from the company emailed several times called several times nothing so now I'm stuck with a pair of crappy socks for 40 bucks!!!
PupSocks,2021-01-10T18:27:14Z,5,big hit with the family and with the face of our new puppy.
PupSocks,2021-01-10T18:26:06Z,5,"Oh my gosh! It came out perfect! I was so happy and the blanket is so soft. I do wish I would have enhanced the colors myself in Photoshop, but that’s just me being a perfectionist and photos are not perfect. However, the job they did was amazing! I would totally do this again."
PupSocks,2021-01-10T18:24:31Z,1,"Shipping took forever and poor quality! Made the order on November 29th and didn’t receive them until a few days after Christmas. It was too late at that point. Contacted the company again and nothing was done. The socks themselves run very large. Ordered a small and they could fit a women’s shoe size of probably a 10. They are also very poor quality with no shape to the sock (the foot of the sock is the same width and shape as the ankle.  So, they don’t stay up on the ankle. The material is also slick and very uncomfortable. It was $30 down the toilet for us. Save yourself and do NOT order these."
PupSocks,2021-01-10T18:23:35Z,2,Sent me other peoples blankets and not the one I ordered try to reach out to customer service and they sent me out an automatic reply it’s been days and they still have not actually gotten back to me .
PupSocks,2021-01-10T18:20:56Z,3,"The quality of the socks isn't great. Shipping was slow - I ordered on Black Friday and didn't receive until early January. The socks are cute and made for a good gift, just too bad they were so delayed."
PupSocks,2021-01-10T18:16:42Z,5,I loved your masks!!!!!
PupSocks,2021-01-10T18:16:39Z,5,"I ordered a pair of socks for my wife for Christmas, using two different pictures of our dog. She loves them! Great, quality product with timely delivery."
PupSocks,2021-01-10T18:14:41Z,1,"I'm sure the pup socks are great. But, I ordered them November 27th hoping to give them as Christmas gifts. It's January 10th and I still haven't received them yet. If I knew it would take over 6 weeks to get them, I would have ordered them earlier."
PupSocks,2021-01-10T18:14:38Z,1,"The socks were tighter than compression socks, there's barely any give in the sock tube and impossible to get on - I ordered a large for my husband based on sizing charts provided. They didn't fit him, so I tried them, still didn't fit me so we gave them to our 6 yo and they're an effort to get on, even for him with tiny 6yo legs. It's a cute idea but the actual product was not great, I wouldn't order these again."
PupSocks,2021-01-10T18:00:05Z,1,"The printer image is nice and clear but the socks themselves are terrible quality. There’s no shape to them at all, they look like straight tubes - would probably be better as arm warmers if you cut the toe box out. Very little padding and no conformity to the shape of a human foot. Disappointing."
PupSocks,2021-01-10T17:51:50Z,1,Made and order back in November and still have not received them. It’s mid January now.
PupSocks,2021-01-10T17:46:49Z,1,"My experience has been awful. I ordered in November and was guaranteed the product before Christmas. I did not get it until after, and it was NOT what I ordered. It was the smaller blanket when I ordered the large, it was NOT MY DOG on the blanket, and I ordered a face mesh not my car and dog, no cat, not my dog, and NOT a face mesh either. Then I reached out to customer service the day I got it 12/28/20 and have STILL not heard back. Today is 1/10/21. They have a 7 day from delivery return policy and I have emailed them several times asking for a shipping ticket or at least return address, with NO response. So since I have mailed the product back to the address listed on the package, along with copies of all my emails to them inside. Then when I got home I sent them a picture of the shipping receipt along with the tracking number for the product. Looking at the tracking now, they tried to deliver it yesterday, but there was no access to the delivery location. Spent way too much money on NOTHING wit NO RESPONSE."
PupSocks,2021-01-10T17:42:52Z,3,The socks were awesome ! The problem is that I received them 3 weeks after the late.
PupSocks,2021-01-10T17:38:55Z,4,Love the product didn’t love how long it took to get it........
PupSocks,2021-01-10T17:38:09Z,5,These were even better than I expected! The picture was perfect! And the quality was great!
PupSocks,2021-01-10T17:37:27Z,4,"My mask turned out so cute! The designer did an amazing job of copying my pupper's face❤ I would've given it 5 starts but the loops that go behind your ears are too big and the mask took a REALLY long time to get here. (Ordered on 11/25, received 1/10)Plus it's kind of thin, if you want a protective mask this may not be the mask for you. I wear mine over my medical mask. But if you're looking for a cute mask that's easy to breathe in this is perfect."
PupSocks,2021-01-10T17:35:31Z,2,"Eh, the product just wasn’t great. The pictures were dark. I was very underwhelmed."
PupSocks,2021-01-10T17:31:31Z,1,Product was ordered end of november. Still never received the product. Multiple emails received after that with misleading information. Also still receiving marketing emails even though the product never came and there were no concrete updates provided on my Order when i reached out to your company.  Dont blame usps. All other companies have been much more organized with holiday delays do to covid 19 usps issues.  Communication methods are awful.  Would not recommend or purchase again. Again still waiting for my product 4+ weeks later.. this was supposed to be a christmas gift. I have also heard from slotOf other reviews that you often send the wrong orders consistently to customers.  Whats going on over there?
PupSocks,2021-01-10T17:31:00Z,1,Terrible- the socks I ordered 6 weeks ago never showed up. I would not recommend this company.
PupSocks,2021-01-10T17:30:42Z,1,I ordered these for Christmas and they took over 6 weeks to arrive. One photo was half cut off and not the photo I asked for. The sock material was also cheap and something I have never seen before. Overall disappointed in the price I paid and quality I received.
PupSocks,2021-01-10T17:22:27Z,5,"There are many companies to choose from that are less expensive... but I chose PupSocks because they donate to their local animal shelter in GA. When I read that in their bio... I was sold on the company. When I received the socks I couldn’t stop laughing at first, they were the cutest things I’ve even seen. I was excited to see the quality of the sock as well. On Christmas my son said it was the best present he received. I highly recommend pupsocks to everyone!!!"
PupSocks,2021-01-10T17:21:45Z,1,"Never received my order, was sent someone else’s order. Emailed company and only received a mass reply email that shipping is slow and out of their control. No response back to my email on what to do with the item I received that is not mine and how to return it. Email sent to me with a picture of my ordered item so it could be sent to whoever I purchased the item for as a gift, so they could see a preview of what they should be receiving; although the color and background were wrong but no actual response to my email pointing that out. Very frustrating and disappointing."
PupSocks,2021-01-10T17:19:45Z,4,"The blanket that finally arrived with my son's former dog is beautiful. It is well made. The pictures are clear and accurate. It has not been washed yet. It is very soft, with a smoother side and a fuzzier side. My one hang up was the time it took for the blanket to arrive, and, although I understand the postal delay, I think communication from the company in a timely fashion would have helped. That being said, I do plan to order another for my daughter."
PupSocks,2021-01-10T17:13:39Z,3,I was very pleased with there customer response when it came to the shipping delays that were out of there control. I wasn’t so pleased with the blanket though. Seems the machine was off when cutting it. It’s definitely crooked around the sides. I understand though the stress the company was under with holiday orders during a pandemic. I am giving 3 stars. As long as we don’t make the bed with the blanket you can’t tell. It’s the two long sides that are cut in a crooked angle.
PupSocks,2021-01-10T17:12:16Z,5,I wanted to receive th before christmas. It was impossible so the companie has sent me images so i can « give » something at christmas! It was appreciated! Finaly i got my 3 pairs and i love them! Great service
PupSocks,2021-01-10T17:12:08Z,1,Cat faces put in dog socks and no response about the issue or before sending order out
PupSocks,2021-01-10T17:07:16Z,1,"Dreadful experience - ordered socks on 11 Nov, didn't show up till beginning of Jan. Two pairs of socks correct, one pair with a random cats face on ha ha! Want my money back... avoid at all costs."
PupSocks,2021-01-10T17:07:05Z,1,Package had been opened when I received it and contained the wrong items. I contacted customer service and got no response.
PupSocks,2021-01-10T17:04:17Z,5,I got my cousin a cover with her dogs face on it and she loved it . she said it's the best gift she ever got ! I want one of my own dogs now
PupSocks,2021-01-10T16:59:22Z,1,Wasn’t even the same dog or picture I sent
PupSocks,2021-01-10T16:56:31Z,3,"I ordered socks in November and emailed the company several times asking where they were  because it is now January and they didn’t seem to answer, however they have now answered and are sending me a new pair of socks. They are fixing problems"
PupSocks,2021-01-10T16:53:07Z,1,Haven’t received my Order after 2 months... tried to contact them and received no response!
PupSocks,2021-01-10T16:52:19Z,5,Excellent service!!! Great product!!  I will be buying again from you!!
PupSocks,2021-01-10T16:52:07Z,3,The soxs are great but it took way too long to process my order. It took about two months for this company to process my order.
PupSocks,2021-01-10T16:48:29Z,4,took a long time for package to arrive but was happy with the product
PupSocks,2021-01-10T16:46:33Z,1,"I ordered some personalised socks as a Christmas present in November and I’m still waiting for them in January. Rubbish service wouldn’t recommend, unless you order 5 years before you need them then you should be alright."
PupSocks,2021-01-10T16:44:09Z,1,"As much as I understand that when a company has some unforeseen problems, the one thing that shocks me about this company is the the communication. I have had my issues with customer being a business owner myself but never commit yourself to something you can’t do, nor ask for a review when people haven’t received their order. I do hope this company gets their act together and a lot of people get their orders. But for now my review stands and i will never buy from this company again."
PupSocks,2021-01-10T16:37:21Z,2,Still haven’t received my order that I placed in the beginning of December!
PupSocks,2021-01-10T16:25:12Z,1,Have not received my order that was placed on December 6th.  Can not get anyone from this company as to why.   This was my daughter’s Christmas present.  They have my money. I want my order!   Do not order from this company.  They are HORRIBLE!  They’ll take your money and you won’t get your overpriced item!
PupSocks,2021-01-10T16:23:46Z,4,Very cute!!! A little late but they were worth the wait! Just like the picture
PupSocks,2021-01-10T16:19:49Z,1,I did not receive all of my order. A pair of socks was missing. I have contacted the company my email 3 times and through social media once and they have not responded. Very disappointed. I was sure they would respond after the holiday rush and make it right but sadly they haven’t.
PupSocks,2021-01-10T16:19:23Z,5,Ordered two blankets as gifts and they were perfect !! Both recipients absolutely loved them. Good quality product !
PupSocks,2021-01-10T16:18:07Z,4,"Very cute, but cropping of the pictures could have been better.  They also fit a little tight with limited stretch."
PupSocks,2021-01-10T16:08:54Z,1,I ordered a pair of these socks on November 29th for a Christmas gift and it's now January 10th and they aren't even showing shipped :(
PupSocks,2021-01-10T16:01:25Z,2,"I was really excited for these socks as Christmas gifts for my daughters. Ordering was really easy and they came quickly. The image of our dog on the sock is super cute, the problem is the sock has no shape at all- just a tube, and is a weird material. All three of my daughters loved the idea but won't wear them unfortunately."
PupSocks,2021-01-10T16:00:12Z,5,Great socks with sweet photos
PupSocks,2021-01-10T15:58:58Z,5,I ordered three pairs of socks with different cats plus a face mask.  I ordered on Black Friday.  The items came in the right timeline and everything was perfect.  They were the hit of the holiday presents.  Will definitely order for other friends and family in the future.
PupSocks,2021-01-10T15:58:36Z,1,I never received my order.
PupSocks,2021-01-10T15:56:17Z,5,The socks were awesome and looked just like I imagined! I ordered as a gift and they were a hit. I highly recommend.
PupSocks,2021-01-10T15:54:40Z,2,"The material is very weird, think dish dish towel, not soft and comfortable.More importantly the shape is WAY off. The toe is boxy and way too big. The mid section too tight. The bottom foot part way too short. I've never experienced this issue with any other socks I've worn. Fix your material and the die cut for the sock and you have a winning formula here."
PupSocks,2021-01-10T15:52:45Z,5,Kids LOVED getting these for Christmas. Picture was cropped exactly as I requested. Shipping was very slow but I didn’t take off any stars for that since it may have been caused by covid issues.
PupSocks,2021-01-10T15:46:50Z,3,I loved the idea of this.  When the socks came my dogs face was super cute however the sock itself was made from some weird material.  l dont think I'll ever wear the socks they will be a novolity item.
PupSocks,2021-01-10T15:41:09Z,1,Ordered these a month before Christmas. My package arrived a couple days before Christmas AND IT WASNT EVEN THE CORRECT ORDER. Emailed customer service and no one ever emailed me back. So now I just have a pair of socks with some random dog on them and I’m out $30. Super disappointing because this was the gift I was most excited to give my fiancé on Christmas.
PupSocks,2021-01-10T15:38:18Z,1,"I probably would give it a better review, but I never received my 2nd order, ordered around November 29, out some money, no communication, people are suffering through a pandemic and still customer get the shaft, won’t order again, stick with Amazon., finally it arrived today,it was a Christmas gift, at least I got it, 3 weeks late."
PupSocks,2021-01-10T15:35:52Z,1,I NEVER received the correct socks and not one response to the many  emails I’ve sent. The prototype that was emailed to me was perfect and adorable but sadly I received someone else’s socks with someone else’s dog.
PupSocks,2021-01-10T15:33:36Z,5,"ordered them as a gift and they turned out great! very happy with design,ease of ordering and shipping!! would definately order again :)"
PupSocks,2021-01-10T15:27:46Z,1,I ordered 2 items for Christmas gifts on 11-29-20. The order confirmation said will be here in 8 to 10 business days. On the 10th business day I received a Email from Pup Socks that said due to a technical error my order will be delayed.I got a Email on December 17th order had been shipped. So as I started tracking the post office did not get order until December 20th. As I write this review on January 10th I still have not got my items. I tried to reach out to customer support but no one has responded. I received a generic email back that blamed the post office and said there was delays on responding back to me. I think that is very bad customer service. My problem is Pup Socks messed my order up and did not make it right. They should have upgraded my shipping or at least offer to me the option to upgrade. They have never contacted me but yet I still get 2 to 3 Emails every week to buy more products. I understand you need to keep selling but if you can’t fill a order from November 29th you should not sell more. If you can’t take care of existing customers you don’t deserve new ones.
PupSocks,2021-01-10T15:27:31Z,1,One of the worst business experiences I can remember. I ordered my socks on Nov. 29 and received them in January. I was told it would be 12-15 business days to complete them. I inquired twice via the website with no response. Then when the product came the quality and feel of the material was below average. I understand businesses have a lot going on but to fail to communicate to my two inquiries is a blatant disrespect to customers.
PupSocks,2021-01-10T15:26:47Z,4,Recipient like her socks.Thanks.
PupSocks,2021-01-10T15:26:21Z,4,"The socks were perfect once we got them.  The shipping problem was not your fault, but the customer service response was not good at all. I realize that you had thousands of concerns to deal with, but it could have been dealt with differently. I kept getting emails that said I would hear from someone in 72 hours and that didn't happen. Perhaps you could have changed your automated response.Will I order again.... Absolutely!"
PupSocks,2021-01-10T15:26:14Z,2,"After submitting an order for 3 pairs of socks, I realized one was the wrong size, and I immediately sent an email asking for the correct size. Instead of sending the correct size, they sent the wrong size twice. Fun novelty, but sock quality is low, and not good enough to wear on a regular basis."
PupSocks,2021-01-10T15:23:02Z,4,"Originally, I was disappointed because my order was mixed up, but once I got in contact with a customer service representative, he was super helpful and apologetic and made everything right. Will definitely use the company again."
PupSocks,2021-01-10T15:22:39Z,3,"The socks are excellent; however, I ordered them well before Christmas because the website stated that they would be shipped in two days.  I just got them last week!"
PupSocks,2021-01-10T15:18:36Z,5,Purchased these socks for my friend for Christmas.  She loves them!
PupSocks,2021-01-10T15:16:57Z,2,This rating is because we haven’t actually received our order yet! I ordered them in November for my son’s Christmas gift. They did not arrive so I hoped they would be here for his birthday. They had not arrived and have missed his birthday!We are still waiting…
PupSocks,2021-01-10T15:14:08Z,1,"BUYER BEWARE!Ordered socks and a mask on November 28/2020 now January 10/2021 and have still not received. Zero communication other than autobot replies and lies about shipping. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SHADY COMPANY. Waste of time, money and excitement."
PupSocks,2021-01-10T15:11:35Z,2,"We ordered a blanket with a pic of a black lab, but couldn’t even tell it was a dog on the blanket. Tried to contact customer service, been over a month now, still haven’t heard back."
PupSocks,2021-01-10T15:11:28Z,5,Even though my order arrived late I’m very happy with the product. I know that USPS and UPS had overwhelming backlogs on shipping DURING THE HOLIDAYS which wasn’t your fault and I appreciate your prompt response to my emails asking where my package was. Your responses and even additional free pair sent to me are greatly appreciated. I will definitely recommend your company and will be buying again!
PupSocks,2021-01-10T15:10:37Z,1,I ordered these on November 28. I received them on December 28. Absolutely unacceptable. They were supposed to be a Christmas gift. $20 for a very cheaply made pair of socks.
PupSocks,2021-01-10T15:09:32Z,5,LOVE PupSocks! The quality is amazing. I bought a pair for my husband for Christmas. As soon as I opened the package and saw the quality I got back on their site and bought another pair for my father-in-law! The shipping was crazy fast too! It is a fun gift idea and so worth it!!
PupSocks,2021-01-10T15:05:50Z,5,Adorable. Made a great gift.
PupSocks,2021-01-10T15:05:13Z,5,Very cute design and my kids loved their face masks with their kitties on them!
PupSocks,2021-01-10T15:03:22Z,1,"I still haven’t received my order. I ordered 2 months ago. This week I received someone else’s socks and have no instructions For how to return them and no one will reply to my emails. I was happy to wait for an order but given the price, I would expect and explanation for the delay and at least some indication of my order’s whereabouts. I’m still waiting:("
PupSocks,2021-01-10T15:02:27Z,5,Very happy with the product. Fast shipping as well.
PupSocks,2021-01-10T15:02:17Z,1,"Ordered in November, shipped December 9th. Still don’t have my socks. These were a gift for someone and still not having them absolutely ruined my Christmas morning. When i check the shipping, they appear lost in transit. Not sure how Pupsocks ships things, but I’m imagining it’s by horseback. I want my money back."
PupSocks,2021-01-10T15:02:03Z,2,The pictures on the socks look great but the material is awful. If you want socks just to look at but not wear these are it. I wouldn’t buy these again.
PupSocks,2021-01-10T14:56:28Z,1,My order was placed on November 5th 2020We are now January 11th 2021 haven got it yetVery disappointed! Never ordering anything again and hopefully I will get my money back

PupSocks,2021-01-10T14:55:06Z,5,My husband loved the socks! He wouldn’t take them off!
PupSocks,2021-01-10T14:52:43Z,1,"I made my order 29 November and today, 10 January, I still haven't gotten my pupsocks. I ordered holiday socks for my mother as a Christmas gift and it's to late to give them to her now. They were kind of expensive as well. So as you can imagine I'm quite disappointed."
PupSocks,2021-01-10T14:51:28Z,1,I placed my order in November. It is now mid-January and the socks are still not here.
PupSocks,2021-01-10T14:51:22Z,1,"I never received the order I placed on Nov.29. I live in Phoenix, AZ. USPS tracking shows that my package left Atlanta, arrived in Phoenix and then went back to Atlanta. I only get a generic automated response email from the company. No customer service. The following is the shipping information:December 29, 2020In Transit, Arriving LateYour package will arrive later than expected, but is still on its way.

PupSocks,2021-01-10T14:51:14Z,3,"Despite the claims, it wasn't super fast to get these- a few weeks, but given the season, that's understandable.   More importantly, these aren't really a clothing product, they are a novelty product.   In terms of quality, comfort and fit I wouldn't pay a dollar for these if they didn't have my cat's picture on them."
PupSocks,2021-01-10T14:48:21Z,4,Was a bit disappointed in how the picture of my puppy turned out on the socks. Don't know if it was the picture that I sent or how it printed.
PupSocks,2021-01-10T14:43:55Z,1,Well I ordered them back in November and I still don't have them so that's pretty effed. You guys gotta step your game up. I mean I get a week or two late but man this is simply unacceptable.
PupSocks,2021-01-10T14:43:04Z,2,Really cute socks and the picture of the pup is clear but the quality of the socks are terrible. Most likely will never wear them which is ridiculous considering how much they cost. Would not recommend unless you are doing it as a gag gift.
PupSocks,2021-01-10T14:42:24Z,1,"I ordered my $70 blanket on 11/29 and have yet to receive it ! Broken promises that it will be coming ? It’s 1/10 and still nothing ! Horrible customer service !! No refund , no blanket ....took six emails to get a response ! Still nothing. Worst experience."
PupSocks,2021-01-10T14:37:10Z,1,"Still haven’t received my order... it has been almost 2 months, it stayed for a month in a depot in Miami... no movement toward Canada at all...We are now mid January and I’m pretty much convinced that I will never see these socks.Blaming everything on COVID is too easy... I suggest to anybody from Canada, not to bother ordering from them..."
PupSocks,2021-01-10T14:33:45Z,3,"I purchased customized masks on 11/28. They did not arrive until early January so I was unable to give them as Christmas gifts which was disappointing. However, given the constraints, I understood. The customization was done well. The mask themselves are more a novelty as they’re too small to cover an adult’s nose and mouth."
PupSocks,2021-01-10T14:32:19Z,5,Adorable socks!!
PupSocks,2021-01-10T14:31:59Z,1,"I don’t know that you can even call these “socks”. It’s more like a long sleeve, sewn together at one end. The material is stiff and nylon-like, not soft. The toe/heel appears to be structured in the pictures, but they aren’t. They are extremely big, they bunch in the front of the ankle and don’t fit my feet properly. The image of my dog was nice and clear, but I will never wear them and I bought them for my “something blue” to wear for our wedding. Save your money. Go buy a pair from divvyup, much better quality of a sock."
PupSocks,2021-01-10T14:30:55Z,1,Order took forever and the socks quality is very poor and the sizing is huge
PupSocks,2021-01-10T14:30:26Z,1,Still have not received the socks..unbelievable! I ordered them well before Christmas as they were supposed to be a Christmas gift..and still nothing. I received an email showing what the socks will “eventually” look like..my kids were not impressed by that at all.
PupSocks,2021-01-10T14:29:11Z,2,"I ordered this product in November. On December 12, your email said it was done and being sent. I didn’t get it until the second week in January. Unfortunately, the blanket was my child’s big surprise present. Worse than that, when we finally did get it, it had flaws on it. The blanket must have been folded or creased when printing, so there are white lines where there should be colored ink- even across our dog’s faces. It’s sad because the material and size of the blanket are great, but the time and the fact that it didn’t come nicely finished ruined it. It was expensive. I expected to get a nicely finished product for the price. Unless I get a new blanket printed correctly, I will be done ordering from this company."
PupSocks,2021-01-10T14:26:56Z,1,Never received the order
PupSocks,2021-01-10T14:23:03Z,3,The socks were cute but probably  work better on light colour pets then darker pets. Also the quality of the socks weren’t exactly what I had expected. But all in they were cute to look at and a really fun joke gift.
PupSocks,2021-01-10T14:22:07Z,1,I ordered from this company in November for Christmas presents. My items never came and it’s Jan 10/21.
PupSocks,2021-01-10T14:20:33Z,2,"I expected better quality of socks and mask. Also, had I known they were made and shipped from China, I would have never purchased."
PupSocks,2021-01-10T14:19:26Z,4,"The socks I ordered were great!  MoreImportantly, the customer service was great!  There was a mistake with my order, but Pupsocks corrected it without any hassle."
PupSocks,2021-01-10T14:16:30Z,5,"Wait time was a bit rough, but that’s what happens when you place an order a couple of weeks before Christmas. As for the product itself, it was purrfect! I ordered a large blanket with 2 cat faces on it and they delivered exactly as I had imagined. Wonderful product!"
PupSocks,2021-01-10T14:15:04Z,2,"I'd give it one star, but in the end they did replace my incorrect product for free.  However, the hassle and shady practices (including having a different--but similar--email address for customer service) made the process not worthy of my time.  And, the quality of the socks was not great."
PupSocks,2021-01-10T14:14:20Z,5,Great work. My daughter loved it! Covid kept it from getting here before Christmas but all in all very happy.
PupSocks,2021-01-10T13:49:51Z,1,"I ordered pup socks on November 28,2020 and as of January 10, 2021. Have yet to receive the 2 pair of socks I ordered as Christmas gifts. It’s impossible to contact pupsocks by phone. I would not recommend this company or product. I emailed asking for a refund and have not heard back."
PupSocks,2021-01-10T13:43:43Z,5,These socks are adorable. I ordered them for my daughter's family and everyone that has seen them love them. A great job putting my daughter's dog's head on them. The customer service help I received was great. I love the fact that purchasing from this company helps to feed shelter dogs.
PupSocks,2021-01-10T13:35:19Z,3,"Sizing issue. The socks were much larger than I had expected. The material isn't very nice although the printing is great, the images look great. The shipping was extremely slow but that was to be expected around the holidays. Overall pleased with the product."
PupSocks,2021-01-10T13:35:08Z,1,"Order was placed Nov 28th and I still have not received my order (Han 10, 2021). Truly disappointed as it was for a gift for a close friend for Christmas :("
PupSocks,2021-01-10T12:53:04Z,5,Bought these socks as a Christmas gift for my wife. Ordering and delivery was quite easy and they arrived in plenty of time for the holiday. My wife’s shoe size (8.5) was in between the sizing of the socks and a quick check with the Pupsocks folks directed me to the smaller size 8 instead of a size 9. My wife reports that the socks fit quite comfortably and she is very happy with them.
PupSocks,2021-01-10T12:19:18Z,1,"This was a terrible experience and won’t order anything again!I ordered in early November, when the socks I ordered came in Mid December, I was a so excited but when I opened the package, it was someone else’s dog, not my cat and on top of that I ordered blue and these were pink.  I wrote immediately and explained the issue.  Knowing I could not get a replacement pair by Christmas, I asked for a refund and that is where I’m at.  Haven’t heard a thing, just ignored me, cricket’s .  Those socks cost around $27.00 and for someone who works hourly, that is a lot of money down the drain."
PupSocks,2021-01-10T12:08:30Z,2,"Do not buy this stuff!! The material used  is weird. I would have not purchased if I knew this. Not even sure what type of material it is? Also, while the pictures on the items were cute, the masks are too small and the little black plastic pieces that are supposed to go on the ends of the loops are impossible to put on...the hole is too small, so the mask does not work since the loops are too big and can’t be adjusted. Not sure why these were not out on before they were shipped??? I loved the concept and we had a good laugh at first,  but this was a waste of money."
PupSocks,2021-01-10T10:50:43Z,5,The delay in shipping was unfortunate but beyond your control with USPS. Maybe guide users to select an alternative shipping method next holiday season to better guarantee timely delivery. The products are great! Dog-lovers need to sport Pup Socks!
PupSocks,2021-01-10T08:45:26Z,1,My order is still not delivered after 8 Weeks but im getting reminders to buy again and write reviews. Everytime i get an email i think my order comes the next day but in fact its just a new advertising. Dissappointing.
PupSocks,2021-01-10T08:43:07Z,1,My pup socks never turned up. Supposed to be a gift for Xmas. 🙁
PupSocks,2021-01-10T08:42:40Z,3,Socks are not a comfortable sock material. There’s also a weird elastic at the top that makes them dig in. I would recommend these just be a novelty item and not expect people to actually wear them. The printing of the photos blends in with the design and the colours are not as vibrant as I would like. They’re fun as a gift but for the cost and the almost 2 month wait to receive I wouldn’t purchase again.
PupSocks,2021-01-10T08:13:11Z,3,"The socks are adorable & my friend will love them, but the quality just isn't there. I understand that the allure of these products is the personalization, but these socks barely have an elastic to hold them up. Cute like a joke gift, but I wouldn't buy again or recommend them to anyone."
PupSocks,2021-01-10T08:09:41Z,2,"My order was lost by the post office. I was unable to call and speak with customer service, because a calling service does not exist. So I sent messages, which took SIX DAYS to get a response. I had started to think I would never hear anything. When I finally did get a response, they had automatically started reprinting my order. While I appreciated that, I would have much preferred a refund since the products were most definitely not going to make it in time for Christmas."
PupSocks,2021-01-10T06:50:07Z,4,The socks were good.  The pics were good.  I got an extra Pair with someone Else’s Dog on them and NO ONE responded to my 3 emails to correct this.  Disappointing.
PupSocks,2021-01-10T06:04:29Z,1,I placed my order on November 27 for Christmas. The package has never been received. Have only received canned response.
PupSocks,2021-01-10T05:56:46Z,5,Great quality socks and the picture is clear. Love my new socks!!
PupSocks,2021-01-10T04:55:12Z,3,Ordered in November and arrived after Christmas so unable to give to my daughter on Christmas. Image was great but fit of socks very boxy. Fit like a tube rather than a sock.  Great as a novelty gift. Not sure they are socks that will be worn otherwise
PupSocks,2021-01-10T04:35:22Z,1,"Absolutely horribly fitting. The seams are off and the fabric is such low quality I don’t even know where to begin. Can’t even wear the socks. The customer service is even worse. No response and when they do, they refuse to refund despite sending photos of how awful the product is. A disgrace of a brand."
PupSocks,2021-01-10T04:18:45Z,1,This was supposed to be a christmas gift. My item was not received before christmas and it was promised before christmas even ordered it on November 26th thinking it would surely be here in a month but no. Maybe next time before you spend on targeted ads you should ramp up production and processing. Also the socks are awkwardly shaped socks. The feet are far to big for the size we ordered and the fact that it would probably take a month to replace makes me sad. The feet are very wide as well. Very disappointing to have spent so much money on a custom product and its not even wearable.
PupSocks,2021-01-10T04:18:28Z,5,"Great socks, parents loved them as a Christmas present"
PupSocks,2021-01-10T04:11:54Z,3,"I ordered the child XS socks as a Christmas gift. They arrived quickly however they were large enough to fit an adult. Customer service response was very delayed as I attempted to determine if I had the wrong size delivered. They were the right size but was told “our youth socks can run a little large”. In the end they offered to replace with another product, but the entire process took close to 6 weeks and has been frustrating."
PupSocks,2021-01-10T03:55:54Z,1,"I ordered a pair of socks and a blanket with a picture of my girlfriend's dog on both.  I received the socks, but the blanket came with a picture of a cat on it.  I've emailed the company and got an automated response that said they're swamped with emails and dont know when they can get back to me.  This was supposed to be a Christmas gift.  I ordered it on november 27th.  It didnt arrive until early January.  It is now January 10th and I still have no idea when my email will be responded to, much less when or if I will get a replacement blanket and/or refund."
PupSocks,2021-01-10T03:35:33Z,5,Exactly as was described! The picture was clear and portrayed just as I had asked. Highly recommend😝
PupSocks,2021-01-10T03:26:52Z,3,"The socks don't quite fit right on the feet. Kinda of bunched up at the feet, but possibly due to me getting a size too big for the wife.  Other than the wrong size, she loves them."
PupSocks,2021-01-10T03:11:54Z,5,Wife loved them!
PupSocks,2021-01-10T03:10:46Z,4,The face of our pup was perfect! It's just that the texture of the socks was not exactly what I thought it would be.
PupSocks,2021-01-10T03:08:07Z,4,"I purchased Pup socks for my 2 nephews and my son for Christmas.  They all love them. The socks are well made and cute.The only negative was how long it took to get them, which wasn't the companies fault."
PupSocks,2021-01-10T03:06:40Z,2,I bought a pair of socks 1 year ago and its was a very good service.I placed a new order in November for a christmas  present and the order is still not arrive after 2 months. I also received an email with a preview of what I will be getting and it is going to be the wrong print. I sent an email regarding all this and never received a response in over 2 weeks. Not satisfied with this second experience!
PupSocks,2021-01-10T03:05:14Z,1,Ordered the socks in November as a Christmas gift and still have not received them.
PupSocks,2021-01-10T02:53:15Z,1,The socks took months to arrive and didn’t arrive until after Christmas. Then when I opened them I was so disappointed to find the material is nothing like a cotton sock! They look huge and were never opened. Such a waste of money.
PupSocks,2021-01-10T02:50:04Z,1,I ordered dog socks as a gift for Christmas. The order was placed in Mid to late November. I received the socks 3 days before Christmas. I was so excited about this gift only to open them and realized they were of cats and not the dog or what was sent on the confirmation. I sent an email in regards to this and the only response I have gotten about the socks is an automatic response about shipping delays. I have sent several emails and still no response and I really want my socks or my money back!!
PupSocks,2021-01-10T02:39:31Z,2,I ordered the socks about 10weeks ago and I’m still waiting for them. They were meant to be a Christmas present. If something is going to take about 3 months to be delivered then we should be informed before actually buying them. It’s not good enough!
PupSocks,2021-01-10T02:25:09Z,1,"The images were great. More than met my expectations. However, the socks are not wearable. The fabirc is not stretchy making them impossible to put on. Too bad. Great idea, but change the fabric."
PupSocks,2021-01-10T02:24:39Z,5,Bought these for my hard to buy for boyfriend of my daughter. HE LOVED THEM!!!! Delivery was quick and they turned out AMAZING!! I won Christmas this year!
PupSocks,2021-01-10T02:21:48Z,1,Shipping and communication were awful. I ordered Nov 28 as a Xmas gift and got it Jan 3. The picture was cute but the mask was the wrong color and the ear loops look like they were sewn on by a 2 yo. From the other reviews I guess I should consider myself lucky I didn’t get a pic of someone else’s pet..or kid
PupSocks,2021-01-10T02:18:14Z,1,The socks are nice to look at but are not made to be worn. Poor quality for use. I would not recommend buying these socks for this price.
PupSocks,2021-01-10T02:05:57Z,2,My items were ordered in November and came way after Christmas. Extremely disappointing
PupSocks,2021-01-10T01:40:35Z,2,"Unfortunately, the socks are uncomfortable.  They are tight fitting and made of a strange fabric.  They also took several weeks to deliver them and were not received in time for Christmas."
PupSocks,2021-01-10T01:36:17Z,1,I still haven't received them
PupSocks,2021-01-10T01:33:59Z,1,I bought the child size socks and received what seem to be adult sizes socks. The socks are a very unusual fit and not at all comfortable in my opinion. After reaching out to customer service over 2 weeks ago I haven't heard back yet. For such a premium price I would have hoped that my daughter could put wear them. Would not recommend the actual product even though the pictures of our dogs came out great.
PupSocks,2021-01-10T01:32:54Z,1,"I placed my order on November 28. Today is January 9 and I still have not received. Very disappointed, especially since it was meant to be a Christmas gift."
PupSocks,2021-01-10T01:24:15Z,4,"Timely delivery, great use of our pic with the chosen background - just a bit disappointed with the feel of the socks..... I probably should have sought out more info on the fabric mix"
PupSocks,2021-01-10T01:12:27Z,5,"I ordered these as a gift and I was very pleased at the image quality of the product! They were adorable! The only constructive thing I think would be helpful on the customer service side is quicker communication of processing and tracking updates and information. I prefer receiving a tracking number to get updates sent to my phone so I know when to go to my community mailbox. Other than that, I loved my experience with Pupsocks!"
PupSocks,2021-01-10T01:10:06Z,2,Material not the same as image on website. Not a great quality finish and delivery took much longer than expected.
PupSocks,2021-01-10T01:02:56Z,1,"I ordered the socks 11/28/2020, didn’t get the item until 1/2/2021"
PupSocks,2021-01-10T00:53:22Z,1,"Ordered 2 items, received both of them wrong. 0/10 stars. Have emailed customer service 4 times. Haven't heard back. Ridiculous"
PupSocks,2021-01-10T00:47:50Z,1,"I really liked what I learned about the integrity of this company and how it gives back to the community. While this site is a little more expensive, I thought it would be worth it. While the socks arrived late, I understand this was not the fault of the company and I appreciated how the CEO handled the situation. Why I gave a one rating was due to the quality of the socks themselves. They are not actually “socks” at all but 2 long tubes made out of a bizarre material. Because they are straight tubes and not shaped like socks, they didn’t fit my daughter’s feet. We had our late dog’s photo put on the socks as a beautiful reminder of her sweet memory but my daughter can’t even wear the socks because they bunch up at the top of her foot. Perhaps I misunderstood but the photos on the site make them look regular socks. We were very disappointed 😞."
PupSocks,2021-01-10T00:32:42Z,4,The image quality is great! The socks were a little tight and not the type of material I expected but they were great as a gift! Would buy again!
PupSocks,2021-01-10T00:32:19Z,5,Pup throw was the hit of the Christmas presents!! Loved the way it turned out and would highly recommend!
PupSocks,2021-01-10T00:19:12Z,5,"Loved these socks and face masks.  I gave them as gifts and everyone loved them.  Only downfall is USPS shipping. One order was placed on 12/5 and finally received on 1/6, after spending 2 weeks in the Springfield USPS Distribution Center."
PupSocks,2021-01-10T00:18:38Z,5,My grandsons loved these socks. The photos of the dogs look just like their beloved English Bulldog and Italian Mastiff. They turned out to be Christmas favorites.
PupSocks,2021-01-10T00:16:17Z,5,The picture I sent was cropped perfectly!  The quality was great & it came in no time!
PupSocks,2021-01-10T00:06:18Z,1,I’m being asked to review a product I never received!
PupSocks,2021-01-09T23:56:58Z,3,The picture was great! Sock quality was very poor.
PupSocks,2021-01-09T23:37:02Z,1,The wrong socks were sent and I’ve tried contacting the company 2-3 times since before Christmas and I just get an auto response about being extremely busy.
PupSocks,2021-01-09T23:34:51Z,2,"Came much later than expected. I ordered a mask...Ear loops are ridiculously long, no idea who they fit. It was for a gift and she can wrap them around her ponytail they’re so long. Actual mask itself is nice but not worth the money as it’s not useable unless you cut the loops off and sew new ones on."
PupSocks,2021-01-09T23:25:55Z,5,The design was amazing and the socks are really high quality. Very happy with how they came out. Only question is...why are the toes made straight instead of curved?
PupSocks,2021-01-09T22:49:59Z,5,Our pup blanket turned out sooo adorable. My daughter loves it. It’s also very soft and not thin!  We love it!!  Thank you.
PupSocks,2021-01-09T22:43:56Z,1,Very Disappointing! I ordered a pup sock and instead I received socks with a random dog. Not to mention the quality of the sock did not match the ad - poor quality! I called many times to resolve the issue and no one got back to me. Finally after more than 2 weeks I got an email that they wanted to give me store credit. I do not want this - I had to order from a different company and was happy with their item. I would prefer to get a full credit and I will be happy to send back the product . I won’t be ordering from Pupsocks again!
PupSocks,2021-01-09T22:32:05Z,2,Cute socks but way to long.
PupSocks,2021-01-09T22:24:19Z,2,"The picture of my pup on the socks is great.  However, they are not wearable.  I purchased these for my son and daughter for Christmas and neither one can wear them.  My daughter is a size 9 with an average width foot and the socks are very loose on her foot and move all over.  My son is a size 14 and he cannot even get the socks on his foot.  I ordered the sizes needed according to the size chart but neither will be able to wear them.  That is a lot of money for socks to just sit in a dresser drawer."
PupSocks,2021-01-09T22:23:55Z,5,"Love these! I got them for my parents, because they have everything, except for these awesome socks! And they love this cat a ton, so they loved these socks!"
PupSocks,2021-01-09T22:16:01Z,1,Never gave me a good time preference and showed up with a hole in the socks.  Thanks
PupSocks,2021-01-09T22:05:11Z,5,I bought these for my dog loving friends for Christmas and they were a huge hit! The pictures were spot on!
PupSocks,2021-01-09T21:58:28Z,1,I have not received my order yet and placed my order well before Christmas.
PupSocks,2021-01-09T21:56:28Z,5,"We love Pupsocks! Have ordered multiple times, great gifts!"
PupSocks,2021-01-09T21:40:56Z,3,"The socks came out cute, but it took a LONG time to get them. I ordered at the end of November. Website says it would take 8 to 10 business days. I got notification that the socks were in production a couple of days after I ordered and no news after that for 3 weeks. I didn't receive the socks until after Christmas (they were meant to be Christmas gifts...)"
PupSocks,2021-01-09T21:40:11Z,4,"The socks had come late, I didn't have any reply to my follow up emails asking about my order, but when they finally came the product was good."
PupSocks,2021-01-09T21:39:19Z,5,the blanket was a big hit with my wife. the quality of the photo reproductions is good.
PupSocks,2021-01-09T21:36:54Z,1,Material socks are made of us awful and not sock material. You shipped it in a bag at Christmas time with your name all over the outside of the packaging and ruined the surprise for my husband for Christmas.   I will never order anything again from you. Not worth what you are charging. Because of the material my husband won’t wear them.  Truly disappointed.
PupSocks,2021-01-09T21:28:08Z,1,Not worth the time or money. Poor quality items that don’t look anything like what’s being advertised online.
PupSocks,2021-01-09T21:20:08Z,5,So fast and easy. They’re  awesome. I’m going to have some made with my face on them.
PupSocks,2021-01-09T21:06:53Z,1,Been waiting for my order of one pair of socks since november.I don't know if it's pup socks or the delivery service they use but this is ridiculous. Hopefully I can get my money back.
PupSocks,2021-01-09T21:00:04Z,4,"The socks received were good. Interesting fabric, not a normal sock fabric, but the images held well when stretched"
PupSocks,2021-01-09T20:58:30Z,5,"Awesome blankets, such a good gift idea"
PupSocks,2021-01-09T20:57:21Z,5,I ordered the cat mask and socks for my sister for Christmas.   They did an excellent job and received before Christmas!   Great Customer service in letting me know the status on my order.   Will use them again!!!
PupSocks,2021-01-09T20:55:09Z,2,"I was really excited to receive these socks as a Christmas present for my partner but the socks came 5 weeks later and arrived after Christmas. They were shipped internationally and it is a busy time of year to receive packages, but the faces on the socks were faded and one was in recognizable despite my photos being very clear. Overall I’m super disappointing and not worth the trouble or time to order a new pair or return the socks."
PupSocks,2021-01-09T20:51:07Z,2,"The socks themselves are nice. The picture of my cat is well-done although I did expect the socks to feel softer. They feel quite silky and less comfortable than I had anticipated. My biggest complaint is with the customer service. I understand that COVID made shipping unpredictable, however, I ordered my socks on November 27, 2020, and did not receive them until January 4, 2021. They also failed to respond to three of my emails inquiring as to where my socks were because it appeared they had been made, but upon calling the delivery company they were not given to them for weeks. Overall, the product is decent but I found the customer service lacking and thus would not order from this company again."
PupSocks,2021-01-09T20:48:29Z,5,These were a gift for my husband and he loved them!
PupSocks,2021-01-09T20:28:44Z,3,I did not like the material the socks were made of
PupSocks,2021-01-09T20:24:45Z,5,cute and well made sox.
PupSocks,2021-01-09T20:03:09Z,1,My order was wrong and i have emailed 5 times and received 1 response saying someone would get back me. That was 3 weeks ago. Crickets since.
PupSocks,2021-01-09T20:01:52Z,3,"Very wide toes, no designated heel. Picture gets quite stretched out"
PupSocks,2021-01-09T20:01:41Z,1,$168 wasted!  Will never order from pupsocks again.
PupSocks,2021-01-09T19:59:04Z,1,The socks were terrible quality.  I don’t even think my boys can wear them because they are made so oddly.
PupSocks,2021-01-09T19:54:17Z,1,"I have been waiting for so long for my order to arrive and it still hasn’t. I ordered on 28th November. No updates, no idea where it is or when it will arrive. Got a cheek to ask me to review, haha."
PupSocks,2021-01-09T19:51:58Z,2,"I have yet to receive my order. It was placed 8n November and still has not arrived. These were Christmas gifts so needless to say,  my family didn't get their gifts for Christmas."
PupSocks,2021-01-09T19:46:32Z,1,The wrong socks were sent with someone else’s dog. Customer service was subpar. Very difficult to get a response. I asked for a refund but that was not honored. A new pair is being made for me but I still have not received them. I would not patronize this company. I wish I would have read the numerous negative reviews before ordering.
PupSocks,2021-01-09T19:45:42Z,5,Fantastic product! Got the large blanket. Images were nicely cropped according to my specs and clear quality. Made an excellent gift! Material is very soft and cozy. Highly recommend!
PupSocks,2021-01-09T19:44:46Z,1,Super cute but socks were too small. Teen daughter couldn’t put them on. Sent email to company with NO response.
PupSocks,2021-01-09T19:37:45Z,5,Loved the socks! My boyfriend loved seeing our puppies face all over them!
PupSocks,2021-01-09T19:29:05Z,5,Product is amazing🤩🤩🤩 the delivery time was much later than what I was told but very happy with blanket!
PupSocks,2021-01-09T19:16:18Z,2,"The photos of the pets were great - super cute.  But the SOCK itself - HORRIBLE.  It isn't even shaped like a sock, just a long tube with adorable pics... so when you put it on your foot, it bunches up on top of your ankle.  The quality of the sock is a deal-breaker.  They have the photo printing down well but that's it.  Not worth the high price for a sock.  At that price, I expected a quality sock as well as the print.  I was disappointed and I ordered these for FIVE men in my family this Christmas.  It was actually embarrassing watching them try to put them on...  :(  Over $100 for 5 pairs of socks that won't be worn.  Ugh."
PupSocks,2021-01-09T19:15:31Z,5,Your service is fantastic. Loved the email that could be shared if order didn’t arrive. Great thinking in someone’s part.
PupSocks,2021-01-09T19:08:03Z,1,They were fat and wide for a kids size I tried them on my foot and they were baggy but short the material was not very comfy. They took forever to come in the only thing they had going for them was the picture of our cat looked very nice  it reminded me of something you'd order off of wish. Not to mention the price for something that seemed so cheap. Very expensive socks.
PupSocks,2021-01-09T19:07:11Z,5,Great fun. Photo is perfect.
PupSocks,2021-01-09T19:01:50Z,3,"These socks are adorable, but the fit and fabric are terrible. Very disappointed 😞"
PupSocks,2021-01-09T19:01:32Z,5,Great socks!  My son-in-laws loved them with their favorite family pet on their new socks!
PupSocks,2021-01-09T19:01:29Z,1,I have ordered 2 weeks before christmas and still havent arrived
PupSocks,2021-01-09T18:57:56Z,5,Socks arrived on time and looked even better than expected! 10/10
PupSocks,2021-01-09T18:55:19Z,5,We made a mistake on our order and the communication was excellent! They got right back to me and helped me every step of the way! I would highly recommend them! And the blankets are excellent l!
PupSocks,2021-01-09T18:52:49Z,3,"I ordered 2 different orders from PupSocks. —First one was a gift to my boyfriends sister who just lost her cat. Socks didn’t come out that great but she still loved them. —My second order, I ordered before the Christmas cut off but it didn’t arrive until after Christmas. I paid extra for shipping and also gift wrap. It didn’t come with the gift wrap either. I’ve contacted PupSocks and haven’t heard back. I know they are definitely busy with everything going on right now but, I feel I should be refunded for shipping and gift wrap. The upside is the pup blanket came out amazing!"
PupSocks,2021-01-09T18:49:52Z,3,"Reviewing this order is difficult for 2 reasons:* I ordered multiple products with varying quality* USPS shipments are delayed for weeksI ordered 2 masks and 1 blanket on Black Friday 2020. I did not receive my package until January 8th 2021. The order wasn’t shipped until December 19th 2020, so it was cutting it close to Christmas anyway (it was a Xmas gift) but pupsocks shipped the package priority 2 day shipping. Again, the post office let it sit at the origin facility for weeks before shipping, which is not PupSocks fault. However, by Dec 19th it was widely publicized that USPS was backed up for weeks, so pupsocks could have attempted to pivot to another shipping company when that was realized. Pupsocks did send me printable proofs of both products which I was able to put into Christmas cards in leu of the actual product. This was a nice gesture. The blanket is great! Warm and decent quality. The crop of my dogs face along with the print quality is perfect. We'll see how it holds up in the wash, but upon first glance it seems great. The masks were of lesser quality. The prints on the masks look great and the material is good, but the masks are too small for an adult face. Both only barely cover your nose and stay on your chin. If you try speaking with the mask on, it either pulls the top down below your nose, or the bottom half of your mouth pops out. Unfortunately the masks aren’t usable for either myself or my fiancé, so we’re pretty disappointed about that aspect of the order. For these reasons I gave this order 3 stars. If the product arrived within a month, or the masks were actually usable, I would have given pupsocks 4 or 5 stars."
PupSocks,2021-01-09T18:46:14Z,1,"I ordered a pair of socks in mid November with the intent of having them be a Christmas gift. I expected just over a month would be plenty of time to receive the product, even with COVID shipping issues. My product was marked as in Pre-Shipment on December 7th, and I emailed the company on December 22nd when I still had not received my product. The company didn’t respond until Jan.3rd, to which I replied and have not heard back nearly a week later. Extremely disappointed and out $35."
PupSocks,2021-01-09T18:37:13Z,3,Have not yet received product but email said that this was my last reminder to leave a comment - so review is based on the experience. I am an international shipment (NZ) and ordered on 28 Nov. I have not yet received the product as of 10 Jan. This was a Christmas present - and I did appreciate the email showing what the product looked like (so I could show my daughter) but perhaps you need to put an easily visible message that international orders to Oceania take 6+ weeks to receive. Hoping to get them soon!
PupSocks,2021-01-09T18:33:53Z,1,"I ordered the pup blanket on November 27th for my Granddaughter for Christmas and I STILL haven't received it yet as of January 9th!!! I was charged in November, this is unacceptable.  If you look at others posts, they have experienced the same problem! Looks like a scam to me!"
PupSocks,2021-01-09T18:21:27Z,5,my daughter loved them
PupSocks,2021-01-09T18:14:25Z,2,It took over a month to receive my order.  The only communication I had was a return email.  Not once did I get a notice of the expected delay until I did my own research.  Also paid for a decorative package and it simply showed up in a amazon bag.  The socks were great and that's why you get 2 instead of 1 stars
PupSocks,2021-01-09T18:12:25Z,1,I received the wrong order...Now I can't PupSocks  to send me the correct Order and I can't get PupSocks to respond to me.
PupSocks,2021-01-09T18:12:02Z,2,"I mean, it'll get the job done, but it's disappointing. On the heels, the socks creased over themselves and are left white without any print. On the blanket I got, my dog is cropped in a way I didn't want her to be and she appears much darker than she did on the socks. She just looks like a chocolate smear on the blanket rather than a dog."
PupSocks,2021-01-09T18:11:45Z,1,"Arrived late, the wrong poor, poor design, no contact and the most expensive pair of socks ever!"
PupSocks,2021-01-09T18:08:09Z,3,"The socks look nice with the cat on them, but they took a month from order to delivery. The fit of socks also leaves something to be desired. There is too much fabric around the toes, and there isn't much of a heel."
PupSocks,2021-01-09T18:06:16Z,5,"Socks are exactly what I had hoped for, and it is great that I could do all 3 pets for each of my kids. They took a REALLY long time to get here, I ordered them on Black Friday and they arrived after Christmas, but they saved the day by sending me a picture of my exact socks so that I could include that in their stockings. Really great customer service!!!"
PupSocks,2021-01-09T18:04:03Z,1,"I ordered 3 products: a blanket, mask, and socks. I ordered them over a month ago and only received the blanket. I’m an very disappointed in the experience I had with customer service telling me that they did not know where it was and basically ignoring me."
PupSocks,2021-01-09T18:03:02Z,3,"Images were great, but..material was unexpected, odd, and impractical.  None of the 3 pairs I ordered as gifts will actually get worn"
PupSocks,2021-01-09T17:59:34Z,5,Always a great gift! Socks are of great quality.
PupSocks,2021-01-09T17:59:08Z,1,I’ve been waiting since November for my order!  It would have been nice to receive updates on shipping or any delays.  I will not be ordering again!
PupSocks,2021-01-09T17:56:46Z,3,"The photo was super cute and very clear. However shipping took a month and the socks aren’t a standard cotton sock material. They’re more like a nylon, super slippery and staticky. They feel very cheap, my boys likely won’t wear them."
PupSocks,2021-01-09T17:55:28Z,2,"Socks are adorable but awkward to wear. Not soft or comfortable at all! So these socks are great for the way they look, but don’t plan on wearing them."
PupSocks,2021-01-09T17:50:35Z,1,Still hasn’t arrived. Ordered 6 weeks ago for Xmas. Promised delivery in 10 days...
PupSocks,2021-01-09T17:49:58Z,1,"Quality is terrible. Product was late, as is usual seen by other reviews or the Facebook group: pupsocks or pupscam.The material is is platicy polyester.  There is no shape to the sock. It's literally a wide tube and no shaping to the foot. Makes it look even worse when on the foot as it bunches. Don't waste your money. Customer service? There is none.  They don't respond to emails, Facebook messages, or any form of inquiry. Your best bet, call your credit card company and let them know pupsocks is a scam and doesn't deliver as promised. That's the only way you'll see any money back and pupsocks shows any accountability.Think twice before you buy.  Don't waste your money."
PupSocks,2021-01-09T17:49:44Z,1,"I ordered cat socks for my daughter for Christmas on November 27th with your ad stating I should allow 15 days for international delivery!  Today is January 9th and I have yet to receive them!  I’m very discouraged and dissatisfied!   I will never order from your company again nor will ever recommend you to anyone.  Sorry, not sorry!"
PupSocks,2021-01-09T17:48:19Z,3,The printing and color was excellent but it is not suitable for wearing. It feels weird and tight when you wear it
PupSocks,2021-01-09T17:46:25Z,1,Response from customer service needs ALOT of improvement
PupSocks,2021-01-09T17:38:53Z,5,The socks were pretty well designed and seem durable from what I've gathered! Now she has a unique pair of socks and a lasting memoir of her furbutt haha. Thanks!
PupSocks,2021-01-09T17:38:26Z,3,They are really cute but not the most comfortable. They tend to bunch at the front part of the ankle.
PupSocks,2021-01-09T17:37:18Z,5,"Received the socks that I ordered for my husband, and he loved them. Great quality, looks great, and are comfortable to wear. My dog’s face looks exactly like the photo that I uploaded, clear, adorable and perfect. I recommend this vendor. Pia Siegmab."
PupSocks,2021-01-09T17:33:51Z,4,I like the idea of the socks and the photos printed are good quality but the actual socks aren’t very soft. More like formal dress socks. But overall super cute and a great concept!
PupSocks,2021-01-09T17:31:52Z,1,"Buyer beware! I reported this company to the Better Business Bureau as my order placed almost 2 months ago has yet to be received. I was shocked to review hundreds of other complaints, many similar to mine. The lack of options to reach out to a customer service department is frustrating and they did not return on their promise to reply within 72hrs. When they finally sent a response, it was a generic email template asking for patience in a high volume time, my issue was never addressed...in fact, it still hadn’t been addressed. I strongly do not recommend."
PupSocks,2021-01-09T17:31:45Z,2,"I ordered socks on December 10th hoping that they would arrive before Christmas. The original scheduled arrival date was December 23rd. Day after day this has been pushed back it is now January 9, a month later and my package has still not arrived. The idea of these socks is really great but due to the extreme shipping time I will most likely not use this service again."
PupSocks,2021-01-09T17:29:18Z,1,"Never got my order, never got a response from customer service. This is a sham company."
PupSocks,2021-01-09T17:28:13Z,2,"I really appreciate getting the new socks free of charge after I got the ones without my picture, however I never received them!"
PupSocks,2021-01-09T17:27:11Z,5,Picture quality on the face mask was perfect!
PupSocks,2021-01-09T17:19:33Z,1,I ordered the bundle of 4 before Christmas and never received the socks!
PupSocks,2021-01-09T17:19:00Z,5,I bought 2 pairs of pup socks for my daughter-in-law for  Christmas. She has 2 dogs and so i had one photo on one pair of socks and the other photo on the other pair.She loved her socks and couldn't wait to wear them to work to show everyone! Great present!
PupSocks,2021-01-09T17:18:22Z,5,Great sox!!  The gift recipient loved them.
PupSocks,2021-01-09T17:17:39Z,3,"Cute, but not what I was expecting. Fair quality for high price. Very long period for delivery. Would not recommend."
PupSocks,2021-01-09T17:17:11Z,3,"I wish I could rate different aspects separately, because the product would be a definite 5 star rating.  My issue is with their communication.  I ordered a product November 23 for Christmas.  Plenty of lead time to arrive.  As the holiday was fast approaching, I finally got a ship note.  Unfortunately, it said drop off pending for about 3 weeks.  I tried emailing the company numerous times to only receive a generic response about the USPS and the pandemic.  I get this.  But I looked online for a phone number to contact customer service and there is nothing.  Thankfully the item arrived Christmas Eve and was a total hit.  So overall I give them a 5 for quality and 3 for communication. I will use this company again, but I will make sure I decide well in advance of a holiday."
PupSocks,2021-01-09T17:16:01Z,5,My order was exactly what I wanted.  My daughter loved them!
PupSocks,2021-01-09T17:14:45Z,5,everything came as anticipated.
PupSocks,2021-01-09T17:14:27Z,1,Product is ok. Took over a month and a half to get products delivered that were ordered on Black Friday. Customer service was useless. I will use other companies in figure. Also note I know several people who had the same exact issue and never even receive their products. Terrible company and customer service
PupSocks,2021-01-09T17:13:30Z,1,I have not received my orders
PupSocks,2021-01-09T17:08:09Z,3,"Crop of my dog's head was strange, so I don't really love the look on my socks. Would be better if I could crop myself or approve/reject the crop used. Order took longer than expected also which was a buzzkill."
PupSocks,2021-01-09T17:05:44Z,4,"The socks look great, one thing I think would improve the business would be to make it possible to order two different colors/sizes of socks with the same pic. I ordered a pair of socks for a husband and wife with the exact same photo of their dog, but I had to upload the photo twice and give the instructions twice. It was two separate purchases when I wish it could have been one. A part of me was worried that two different employees would crop the picture for the socks (one employee working on the husband’s and one on the wife’s) and that one sock would look a little better/different cropping than the other. It looked great, but I had that worry. The ordering process would have been simpler if I could have ordered two different colors and sizes while only uploading the graphic once and giving instructions once. Great product, thank you!!"
PupSocks,2021-01-09T17:05:32Z,5,I ordered these socks to give as a gift to my daughter. I wasn't expecting much other than a feeble attempt at putting a picture on a sock. What I received was a complete opposite. The PupSock staff edited my photo to perfection and exceeded my expectations with not only the quality of the photo but the socks themselves. This gift will be around for quite some time! (Its a good thing I bought the value pack so that my daughter will at least rotate the socks for laundering....she LOVED them)
PupSocks,2021-01-09T17:03:02Z,3,Got someone else's socks.
PupSocks,2021-01-09T17:02:10Z,1,"I ordered my socks in November for a Christmas gift, and I still have not received them (Jan. 9)."
PupSocks,2021-01-09T16:57:48Z,1,I ordered a mask 11/27/2020 for a gift. As of today 1/09/2021 i have not received it.
PupSocks,2021-01-09T16:52:42Z,3,I love your product.  Very pleased with the Blankets.  Customer service is not good.  I ordered two blankets at the same time and only received one.  This was supposed to be a Christmas present.  I have tried multiple times to reach out and only have received a mass email.  Today I received two copies of the missing blanket as well as someone else’s dog blanket.  I feel sorry for the person with the Dachsund who didn’t get their blanket!!
PupSocks,2021-01-09T16:51:05Z,1,I purchased them but never received the 2 pairs.  This is a blatant rip off.
PupSocks,2021-01-09T16:50:45Z,1,"Never recieved socks. Reached out 2 seperate times.Update: almost 4 months, no socks, said they are sending them, offered a 20% discount on my next purchase... kind of a slap to the face. It's all good I'll take my novelty sock purchases elsewhere."
PupSocks,2021-01-09T16:50:09Z,1,Disappointed! I ordered two pair of socks in the last week of November. I received one pair of socks with the wrong picture on it two days before Christmas. I emailed Pupsocks. I received an automated response about the delivery problem that was being experienced all over and was asked to be patient. I sent another email a week later. I received the same automated response. Today is January 9th. I have not received my socks OR a response from Pupsocks. I would NOT order from this company. They do not  respond to their customers.
PupSocks,2021-01-09T16:48:23Z,5,Socks were a big hit!  Absolutely adorable!
PupSocks,2021-01-09T16:47:44Z,1,A blind person could see this was not a good looking display choice for a blanket.  I did not realize I had to say please do our cats picture exactly like the golden retriever sample we saw with blue between pictures.  We were super bummed out to finally get our blanket and see how awful it looked.  So much so that we’ve never even used it. It looks THAT bad. I wish I could post a picture with this review so you could see just how awful it looks.  Especially for the price.  Would NOT recommend.
PupSocks,2021-01-09T16:41:38Z,5,The picture on the socks was identical and the company used my tips as far as how I wanted them to look. Well worth the $$$$. My daughter loved them!
PupSocks,2021-01-09T16:41:14Z,1,The material is not comfortable.  Our family is not wearing them. It was a complete waste of money at $40 a pair
PupSocks,2021-01-09T16:38:07Z,1,"Haven't received my order, been 6 weeks."
PupSocks,2021-01-09T16:36:37Z,1,"I don’t know what material these socks are made of but it is terrible, and these socks do not seem like they were made for human feet. I cannot believe these socks are $30 a pair."
PupSocks,2021-01-09T16:35:23Z,5,"I ordered 2 pairs of socks & 1 mask for my daughter. She was THRILLED!! I submitted 3 different photos, & they  really looked like the pics I submitted.  And to top it all off, they arrived before Christmas :). Thank you Pupsocks!!5 stars for you!!"
PupSocks,2021-01-09T16:35:10Z,5,They are fabulous thank you.
PupSocks,2021-01-09T16:34:40Z,1,I ordered one month ago and still did not received my goods!!!!
PupSocks,2021-01-09T16:33:13Z,4,Graphics were great. The sock material quality could be better.
PupSocks,2021-01-09T16:32:22Z,3,"The pictures were great & cute, but the sock material is not cotton/does not breathe."
PupSocks,2021-01-09T16:32:05Z,4,"I ordered 4 masks, they were too small for adults. More like a children’s size.  Not wearing as they don’t cover nose and mouth"
PupSocks,2021-01-09T16:31:01Z,5,They are adorable!  It was a relatively quick process from ordering to delivery. My daughter loved them!
PupSocks,2021-01-09T16:30:51Z,4,"Really cool product and the image on the socks looks really nice. A bit pricey, especially since these were a gift for a 10 year old boy who loves his dog. I would be inclined to order more products if the price was not so high."
PupSocks,2021-01-09T16:29:50Z,1,I still haven't got my order yet
PupSocks,2021-01-09T16:29:50Z,1,Order still hasn’t arrived over 7 weeks later. No response for the company for an update.
PupSocks,2021-01-09T16:29:46Z,5,Easy process from layout to ordering - shipped in a timely manner and was a quality product. Many layout options and I ended up with a pair of socks with both of my daughters cats on them that she loved. Price is what you expect for such a custom order like this. Unimaginable even a few years ago.
PupSocks,2021-01-09T16:28:07Z,5,My son loves his socks. We lost our dog earlier in the year so having a reminder close to him comforts him.
PupSocks,2021-01-09T16:25:51Z,2,"These are very expensive socks, cheaply made. They are just printed on a tube of nylon, no shape at all. And as they expand to fit your leg, the image fades a lot. I bought several at once and while waiting I put in another order for other friends. Not worth the money. AT ALL. It also took a VERY long time to receive them. My husband works in logistics so I understand shipping is slower for a variety of reasons, but they must have been on a slow boat from China."
PupSocks,2021-01-09T16:25:15Z,5,Love the socks! It was a perfect gift to remember our life-long friend
PupSocks,2021-01-09T16:23:43Z,3,"The quality of the stock I did receive was good, however, one pair of socks was missing all together and 2 pair had the wrong faces on them, despite the instructions being clear."
PupSocks,2021-01-09T16:22:10Z,1,No communications from company. Took 7 + weeks to get order and socks are terrible quality. Not really wearable.
PupSocks,2021-01-09T16:22:08Z,5,"They were easy to order, and they look so good! We ordered for Christmas, and shipping was way behind because of COVID. In response to that, without me even asking for it, they created and emailed mockups of the 3 pairs I ordered so I could show my kids and husband. That was great."
PupSocks,2021-01-09T16:22:04Z,5,I loved the two pairs for socks. Well made and great quality.
PupSocks,2021-01-09T16:18:45Z,1,I have no idea if what I order is any good. Ordered in November and I still have not received my order. It ended up being the worst secret Santa gift ever and I had to go out during a pandemic to buy a replacement gift. I would never order again. Product descriptions should indicate items will take two months to receive. Faster to order from China.
PupSocks,2021-01-09T16:17:02Z,1,"I ordered a blanket and socks November 27th, 2020 and I still don't have what I paid for. I have emailed with no response. I did get a system generated email the night before Christas saying that orders were on their way but here it is, 1/9/2021 and still nothing. You wanted me to write a review- here it is- DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SITE!!! I want my money back ASAP! I have a sad daughter who was really looking forward to this."
PupSocks,2021-01-09T16:14:53Z,3,Easy to use website and picture of my dog came out great. I just really don’t like to sock itself. It’s a weird texture.
PupSocks,2021-01-09T16:11:58Z,5,Very good material. I got a Blanket with both of my dogs on it. They are also very fast with a response even through the holiday season.
PupSocks,2021-01-09T16:08:59Z,1,Took forever to ship- took forever to even get help from customer service. Socks were a weird fabric. Not worth the money.
PupSocks,2021-01-09T16:08:22Z,1,Ordered socks in Nov and we are now in January and still nothing
PupSocks,2021-01-09T16:07:54Z,5,"Fun socks, look just as promised"
PupSocks,2021-01-09T16:05:05Z,2,Took five weeks to get these socks.  I hated the fabric of the socks!
PupSocks,2021-01-09T16:05:05Z,5,I’ve ordered three pairs of socks and we’ve loved all of them. They are good quality and look great!
PupSocks,2021-01-09T16:03:45Z,5,Adorable mask with good construction.
PupSocks,2021-01-09T16:02:55Z,1,"We ordered three weeks before Christmas and still have not received our order. (today is January 9th). We do, however, continue to receive junk emails, requests and all kinds of spam from PupSocks."
PupSocks,2021-01-09T16:01:37Z,1,Still waiting for my socks. Ordered two months ago and customer care is not answering. I think this is a scam or the company is drowning. I want my money back.
PupSocks,2021-01-09T15:59:36Z,1,"I'm very disapponted with your services, because my delivery has almost a 2 month delivery time"
PupSocks,2021-01-09T15:59:20Z,2,Poor quality-for the price I expected soft material not compression socks.
PupSocks,2021-01-09T15:56:23Z,1,I am so upset with how my blanket turned out. One picture was cropped so you can’t even tell what it is. One picture is so dark it looks black. If they were not good quality then y’all should’ve reached out to me. I have emailed customer service but yet to hear back. So disappointed with how this Christmas gift to my father turned out.
PupSocks,2021-01-09T15:53:33Z,1,I’ve been emailing about the wrong socks you sent. There is no response back.
PupSocks,2021-01-09T15:53:23Z,1,"Ordered one pair of socks and one mask for a Christmas gift at the end of November 2020. It’s January 9, 2021 and still waiting."
PupSocks,2021-01-09T15:53:19Z,1,Product has not arrived 6 weeks after ordering it!
PupSocks,2021-01-09T15:53:15Z,1,"We haven’t received the product and it hasn’t been shipped yet. Ordered November 23, now January 9."
PupSocks,2021-01-09T15:53:08Z,1,Ordered these in November as a Christmas gift....and still have not received them.
PupSocks,2021-01-09T15:52:50Z,1,I was so excited to find you guys and read several reviews before placing an order. Most of the reviews were positive so I decided to order socks with our dogs face. We ordered these in November for a Christmas gift but sadly they didn’t come until January. We ordered two pairs of socks and the quality of the dogs face is poor on both pairs unfortunately. I understand that you were busy with multiple orders this time of year but it would have been helpful for you to let the customer know about the quality of the photo. They were taken on an iPhone 11 and typically I’ve never had an issue with photo quality. I am also in Canada so with our exchange rate I ended up paying over $30 per pair and it totally wasn’t worth it in my opinion.
PupSocks,2021-01-09T15:52:32Z,1,Order not receive
PupSocks,2021-01-09T15:52:04Z,1,"The socks came quickly, but it wasn’t my dog. I tried emailing to figure out how to correct this problem, only to get an automated response that someone would contact shortly because they were super busy. Have yet to get that contact. Gave up and ordered from a different company"
PupSocks,2021-01-09T15:51:46Z,3,"Cute product, but socks are undersized and feel cheap"
PupSocks,2021-01-09T15:49:42Z,3,"The socks came in a timely manner. The print quality is fantastic, the picture was cropped well. The sizing for the length was good, however the material of the socks is not very stretchy width-wise. Which means that they fit ok in some parts of the foot but not in others. Parts were too loose and saggy and other parts were too tight. This made the socks not really usable beyond being a gag gift. I got them for my partner and I wonder if they’d work better in my size since I have narrow feet so worst case scenario they’d be loose everywhere but at the price point I am not likely to experiment more."
PupSocks,2021-01-09T15:48:21Z,5,"My family were so surprised and thrilled! They seem to need stronger elastic at the top, but a very fun product"
PupSocks,2021-01-09T15:47:04Z,1,I have yet to receive my order and no contact
PupSocks,2021-01-09T15:45:28Z,5,I have not yet received my purchase. That I made back in early December. Messaged the company and there response was UPS was really busy with the pickup.. that still didn't answer my question.. WHEN WILL I GET MY PURCHASE??? So much for giving it as a Christmas gift..
PupSocks,2021-01-09T15:45:23Z,3,I still haven’t got my order yet which I ordered over a month ago so I can’t review a product I have yet to receive. I also haven’t got any current updates on the order since Dec. 17 so I have no idea where it is at all.
PupSocks,2021-01-09T15:43:18Z,5,These exceeded my expectations - as a surprise gift for a friend. The image was very well represented on the socks.
PupSocks,2021-01-09T15:42:47Z,2,"Disappointed  to say the least. Poor quality,  and arrived a week and a half too late. Cute idea. But I wouldn't purchase again."
PupSocks,2021-01-09T15:42:32Z,1,"January 9th Ordered November 27th, did not received my order yet."
PupSocks,2021-01-09T15:42:32Z,1,I did not get the correct order. I have tried multiple times to find out about getting a refund or the correct order sent to me.
PupSocks,2021-01-09T15:40:31Z,2,Order was late
PupSocks,2021-01-09T15:39:21Z,1,"I never received my order, well the package arrived, opened and empty. I’ve emailed several times and no one has gotten back to me."
PupSocks,2021-01-09T15:37:24Z,1,"Still have not received out order from the beginning of NOV!!! I have reached out twice and have yet to get a response, not a happy customer."
PupSocks,2021-01-09T15:37:00Z,2,I ordered two pair of socks and a blanket. I received the blanket and my daughter loves it. I never received the socks.
PupSocks,2021-01-09T15:29:28Z,1,"I would steer clear of ordering at the moment until the backlog of the holidays has cleared. I placed my order on Nov.28 and as of Jan.9 still haven't received my socks despite them having been shipped Dec.3 (I'm in Canada). Contacting the company gives you an auto-reply written before the holidays basically stating the company is overwhelmed and will eventually reply personally and it's the fault of postal services.UPDATE: received my ""socks"" Jan.10! I wish I could attach a picture. The shape isn't sock shaped. Its flat. And not very stretchy. So it doesnt follow the heel and it bunches up at the front of the foot. Serves only as a joke gift I guess...pretty expensive joke if you ask me. VERY disappointed is an understatement."
PupSocks,2021-01-09T15:28:39Z,5,Great quality socks.
PupSocks,2021-01-09T15:24:59Z,1,I had high hopes for these. Unfortunately these socks are not stretchy at all and are very uncomfortable. The material feels cheap and there is no shape to these socks. Will probably end up throwing them away. Definitely will never wear them. The pictures they put on them are very cute so that’s sad.
PupSocks,2021-01-09T15:23:47Z,1,I still haven’t received anything
PupSocks,2021-01-09T15:23:11Z,5,The blanket I purchased for a gift is adorable and the person I bought it for loves it!!
PupSocks,2021-01-09T15:22:55Z,1,My original order went in November. Never recieve socks bc the picture didn't go through   However was not notified found out on my own so I reordered on Dec 7. It is Jan 9 and I am still waiting for my socks!!!!!  Unacceptable!! Not good service if you actually want the product.
PupSocks,2021-01-09T15:22:00Z,5,I purchased a blanket and socks for a Christmas gift. Everything arrived on time and the items turned out better than expected. The blanket is so soft and is now the main blacket in our family room.
PupSocks,2021-01-09T15:20:50Z,1,"I would give a ""zero star"" if that was an option.  I placed, and paid for, an order on 12/3.  It is 1/9, and I have not received the order.  It was, unfortunately, a Christmas gift.  I have emailed several times only to get an immediate response, each time the same auto response, that blames the delivery service.  Oddly, I have placed many orders since 12/3 and have received them all via the same Fed Ex/UPS/postal service.  I have requested a refund, to no avail.  I will not be using this company again."
PupSocks,2021-01-09T15:16:22Z,5,I purchased socks as well as a large blanket with our cats’s photo on them.  My daughter was beyond excited to receive them for Christmas. Thank you so much!
PupSocks,2021-01-09T15:13:50Z,5,They were okay.
PupSocks,2021-01-09T15:11:55Z,5,Pupsocks did amazing work! I ordered these as a gift for a friend and she absolutely loved them. The quality was great and the shipping was fast! Thank you!
PupSocks,2021-01-09T15:10:21Z,3,The colors and imagery are awesome! The material however is not very nice and they have zero shape. The socks can be worn on special occasions maybe but they’re not great as socks. Good for the price though.
PupSocks,2021-01-09T15:09:32Z,2,The picture I sent and the actual cat is FLUFFY and PupSocks edited out all the fluff.  Doesn't even look like our cat.
PupSocks,2021-01-09T15:03:38Z,2,"I haven’t received them yet!! But you have emailed me letting me know they are in transit, which is why I didn’t give you one star."
PupSocks,2021-01-09T15:01:48Z,4,Very cute socks!
PupSocks,2021-01-09T14:57:42Z,5,They were exactly as advertised.
PupSocks,2021-01-09T14:55:42Z,5,The process was easy and the items I ordered turned out amazing!
PupSocks,2021-01-09T14:48:26Z,5,They were great! My mother loved them and I appreciated the communication and offer of an email showing the gift when they didn't make it on time for Christmas  :)
PupSocks,2021-01-09T14:45:59Z,1,The design is great.  The socks are horrible the feet in the socks are to big for the price you pay for the socks is very expensive and you can’t even wear them
PupSocks,2021-01-09T14:44:46Z,1,"I placed an order with Pup Socks on December 7, was notified that the order had shipped on December 14 and have yet to receive the order.  I’ve sent multiple communications to customer service and received vague responses that do not provide a resolution.  I asked for a replacement a week ago and have received nothing in response.  Of course, you can’t actually speak to someone, all communication is by email.  This company has my money and I have nothing.  This is the most horrific customer service I’ve ever experienced."
PupSocks,2021-01-09T14:03:07Z,1,I ordered a kids size sock and received adult size. Emails were not returned.
PupSocks,2021-01-09T13:57:59Z,1,They are an amazing idea. When I bought them I thought they were quite expensive. Upon receiving they look decent but seemed like a strange cut and not a comfortable material. We have to our three kids and every one of them says they’re not comfortable at all - material and cut is odd and not useful for socks. I would never buy these again or recommend to anyone.
PupSocks,2021-01-09T13:34:58Z,5,"my wife loved her new socks, they turned out great, picture was one she took so she recognized it right away. Thanks"
PupSocks,2021-01-09T13:16:56Z,5,"Didn’t get them in time for Christmas so allow 2 + months to ship to Canada but great socks! Clear images, nice fabric. Will definitely order again."
PupSocks,2021-01-09T13:07:02Z,5,So cute! Bought them for my father in law. His dog is almost 17! So happy to have something wearable with his picture on it.
PupSocks,2021-01-09T12:54:21Z,1,"Order on November 28th, and I didn’t receive my order yet the company doesn’t respond to my e-mail.My very disappointed"
PupSocks,2021-01-09T12:37:43Z,3,"The socks are super cute, but they’re not very stretchy, and therefore not very comfortable."
PupSocks,2021-01-09T12:33:41Z,4,I have ordered a few times and normally no issues...I understand this holiday was crazy. I ordered before Thanksgiving and one order was pair was lost and resent and one was pair took weeks to be sent. I received both after Christmas. I will give them another chance but very disappointed. When emailed I received the same blanked email but have to say customer service was very kind. The product itself is amazing and super cute gifts!!
PupSocks,2021-01-09T11:53:02Z,1,"I ordered a pair of socks as a Christmas present on December 9, 2020 and it is now January 9, 2021 and still have not received my order. It’s sad to pay almost $30 for a pair of socks and not receive them."
PupSocks,2021-01-09T10:35:47Z,5,I bought two pairs with our family dogs and they came our great 👍
PupSocks,2021-01-09T09:21:15Z,1,Still not arrived and despite emailing company twice only get automated responses - ordered November 20 now mid jan 21 -
PupSocks,2021-01-09T07:09:24Z,1,Received the wrong socks. Emailed. Said new socks will be shipped shortly. Still no socks and 2 weeks after Christmas. Horrible customer service. Just want refund and won’t reply.
PupSocks,2021-01-09T06:54:22Z,1,Have not received shipment placed over a month ago
PupSocks,2021-01-09T06:16:12Z,4,I ordered 3 pairs of socks with my dogs face on it to give as Christmas gifts. The photo quality was surprisingly good. The thing I didn’t like is the sock quality. They make packed without and sizes on them. I ordered 3 different sizes so figuring out which was which took some time. They were tight around the leg and pretty loose around the toes. I don’t think you can actually wear these.
PupSocks,2021-01-09T05:58:13Z,1,Product never arrived. Money down the drain
PupSocks,2021-01-09T05:50:57Z,1,"I submitted a photo of a dog w a Santa hat and put in the notes “keep the hat” they did not so her head was misshapen. The texture and materials used was not as expected, totally weird, and something I would never buy in the store. 100% not worth $30 after shipping."
PupSocks,2021-01-09T05:38:34Z,4,was happy with the image after it had been cropped.  wish it was a little brighter tho. my lady loved them so I would recommend this to others
PupSocks,2021-01-09T05:13:03Z,4,"I think you did really good overall, such a shame this delivery thingy happened. Good luck to you guys, this idea is brillant and I can’t wait to receive my socks (present for my parents!)"
PupSocks,2021-01-09T04:45:24Z,1,"Placed my order Nov. 27. Received my order mid-December but did not open until Dec. 23, to wrap the gift for my daughter. Emailed on Dec. 23 to state I received the wrong item - wrong color, wrong picture - and received a canned auto-response. Emailed again Dec. 28 to receive the same response. Finally received an email Dec. 30 from someone ""assigned to my case"" stating this was a ""one-off"" situation and that things would get back on track quickly, but first they needed proof that I received the wrong item. I sent a picture 3 days ago of the wrong item I received and am still waiting for an actual response, refund, or any kind of resolution."
PupSocks,2021-01-09T04:25:46Z,4,"Honestly everything was great! Love the design was exactly just how my puppy look, but wish the sock material was a bit softer or cozier to weird."
PupSocks,2021-01-09T04:23:44Z,1,"I have not yet received my pup socks blanket, and ordered it 6 weeks ago.  They said it would be here by Christmas.  So I can’t actually review the product, because it hasn’t arrived, but can review the fact that they did not deliver on what they said would happen, which was me getting my blanket (which was supposed to be a gift for someone) by Christmas."
PupSocks,2021-01-09T03:55:45Z,5,"I bought a blanket for my daughter for Christmas and she absolutely LOVES it!! It didn’t arrive in time for Christmas but no fault of pupsocks, I live in Canada and it was a customs issue."
PupSocks,2021-01-09T03:50:52Z,1,I wish I could rate 0 stars!! I ordered a pair of socks on November 27 for a Christmas gift. On December 14th I had still not received them and inquired as to what was happening. On December 16th I received an email offering a 25% discount and quick shipment of the socks.It is now January 8th and I have not received the socks or my 25% refund. Avoid buying at all costs. Most likely this site is a scam. Or at best it's a very poorly run business that deserves to go bankrupt.
PupSocks,2021-01-09T03:49:41Z,5,The socks turned out great! We love how they look!
PupSocks,2021-01-09T03:42:51Z,1,"Took 1 whole month to deliver, and delivered the wrong order. Only good part is they gave a 8% refund."
PupSocks,2021-01-09T03:12:15Z,2,Socks were too small and picture looked a little weird. Not using them
PupSocks,2021-01-09T03:06:40Z,5,My order did ship later then expected and then got lost in USPS land during the holidays but was worth the wait!  My daughter loved her new puppy blanket. :)
PupSocks,2021-01-09T02:51:51Z,1,Product never received
PupSocks,2021-01-09T02:50:39Z,1,Two orders both incorrect. Not sure how you can upload the wrong picture to the wrong order but you managed to do it twice and still send a mock up with the correct picture. Will never buy from this site again. Now to see how long it takes to get a refund.
PupSocks,2021-01-09T02:45:14Z,5,Perfect! Exactly how I pictured.
PupSocks,2021-01-09T02:35:36Z,1,Quality is mediocre and the masks barely stay up. I ordered 4 and got them 3 weeks after they were expected and they didn’t even send all 4.I’m disgusted. They use excuses to why they can’t contact customers or give refunds and it’s awful honestly.
PupSocks,2021-01-09T02:22:10Z,1,"Quality of the socks is terrible. These were expensive socks. While they are cute, the socks will never be worn because the material is so cheap and quality so poor."
PupSocks,2021-01-09T02:21:42Z,2,"I placed an order on Black Friday that was unfortunately received after Christmas. Due to the length of time it took to process the order I reached out to customer service to request a change of address as I was moving. It did take 5 days to get a response, but I did receive a link to change the address of my order because it was in the right status. However when tracking the package the USPS noted it was still shipped to the old address and would be rerouted through forwarding I set up. That delay caused me to get my package a month after it was placed. Then when I finally received it my order was incomplete! I was missing one of the masks I ordered. I submitted a customer service request on December 26th and I STILL have not received a response from the company as of Jan 8th. In contrast, I placed a separate order on Dec 24th and it was shipped by Dec 28th and has already been received. I understand shipping delays but it was unfortunately errors from the company that caused my dissatisfaction."
PupSocks,2021-01-09T02:14:57Z,1,Socks were awful. Yeah got pups pic on which is cool. The fabric though. It’s not like a normal sock at all. Loose fit. Take a regular wal-mart sock all day.  Ended up Kinda a  novelty gift.
PupSocks,2021-01-09T02:12:50Z,2,I ordered this on 28 Nov. It’s 9 Jan now and I still haven’t received them yet. Totally missed Xmas.
PupSocks,2021-01-09T02:10:44Z,5,"The socks looked perfect and came out just as I expected, I’m very happy with this purchase!"
PupSocks,2021-01-09T02:10:34Z,5,"This blanket is amazing! My daughter loves it! Not only is it adorable with her cat’s face all over it, but the blanket it incredibly soft! I would highly recommend the blanket!"
PupSocks,2021-01-09T02:02:35Z,5,"Very pleased with my purchase. I was worried they wouldn't arrive in time for Christmas, but I got my package in plenty of time."
PupSocks,2021-01-09T01:57:19Z,5,"Ordered as a stocking stuffer and wore it the day I received it! Really cute, couldn’t resist!"
PupSocks,2021-01-09T01:39:44Z,1,"I ordered a pair of custom socks for my daughter for Christmas and they never arrived, when I check the tracking order, it stops on December 13th and then nothing. I messaged the company and they said, I never purchased from them, I sent them another message with my confirmation number and they still said, I never purchased from them but then they keep sending me emails to purchase something and to write a review. They will not refund me or send me another pair. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY!!!Very disappointed in this company"
PupSocks,2021-01-09T01:35:01Z,1,Received the wrong item. Contacted the company in regards to this three times with no response. The socks I purchased were a Christmas gift and as they were wrong I couldn’t give them.
PupSocks,2021-01-09T01:25:49Z,3,My daughter cried so hard when she opened up her pup socks!! The thought of the gift was amazing!!  But the quality of the print was not good at all!!  The print of her puppy seems to be really faded!!  Definitely not what I expected for a $30 pair of socks!
PupSocks,2021-01-09T01:24:31Z,5,"I ordered and received socks for my son for Christmas. He adores his cat and really liked the socks with his cat’s picture on them.I also ordered him a mask with his cat’s picture on it. My husband got a little Maltese on Halloween and I got a mask for him with the dog’s picture on it. He love it!I would suggest two things... First... Make the ordering process easier. I got so fumbled the first time that I ordered the wrong size.Second... Ask the customer if they double checked the size.I ended up ordering the wrong size socks for my son....( I don’t buy men’s socks very often.)However, it worked out. Using the socks that were too small, I made my son 3 other gifts...a holder to go around his cup, a stocking for his cat and even a little pillow for his cat!( I also ordered my son the right size cat sock) He loved all the gifts!"
PupSocks,2021-01-09T01:10:32Z,1,Ordered early November and still have not received.  Contacted customer support last week and no resolution.  Very disappointed and frustrated.
PupSocks,2021-01-09T01:06:36Z,1,"Quality was horrible. The images looked great, but the socks looked giant and didn’t even look like they’d fit. Threw them away rather than giving as a gift."
PupSocks,2021-01-09T00:57:01Z,2,"Don't fit to size, print quality is poor, socks are not comfortable. Thought they would be higher quality material for 40 dollar socks. Oh and it took 4 weeks to recieve it. It is probably a blessing in disguise they didn't come in time for xmas as it is better not to be let down on the holiday.Good marketing/advertising i must say, got me!"
PupSocks,2021-01-09T00:49:24Z,1,I did not receive what I ordered. I registered a compliant with PayPal and you did not responded. I would never recommend your company
PupSocks,2021-01-09T00:42:43Z,3,"The images on the masks with the short hair chihuahua faces turned out good!  The masks with the little girl's face was fine, except her shoulder-length curly hair was cut off so the image looked more like Peter Pan than herself.  I think the image comes out better if the photo subject has short or no hair. The mask material is soft and a bit heavy (sticks to your nostrils when you breathe in), and a little bit on the small side for an adult.  Nonetheless, it made for thoughtful gifts."
PupSocks,2021-01-09T00:17:53Z,1,Worst experience ever. I ordered these items a month before xmas. never received an update on my order or advising they were behind. Did not receive the socks for my xmas gift. Then several days later received an email advising they are shipping a new item as the item I received was incorrect!!  It is now the 8th of Jan and still have not received my order. I could only imagine the orders that were purchased in December. Never again
PupSocks,2021-01-09T00:16:49Z,1,Wrong product sent. Received socks without my dogs face on them
PupSocks,2021-01-09T00:12:51Z,5,Easy to order. Expedient and quality service. The recipients of the Pup Socks love their gifts!
PupSocks,2021-01-09T00:03:35Z,1,"They took 5 weeks to deliver, I ordered them a month before Christmas so that they would be here in time and they weren’t. Their customer service is horrible, I’ve sent multiple emails and no response. To top it off when I received the socks finally the quality is awful, the material is not sock material that anyone would be comfortable wearing and the photos are super blurry. Worst experience. Do not purchase socks from here. There are lots of other sites that do the same thing."
PupSocks,2021-01-08T23:59:52Z,1,i ordered my product on November 27th and haven't received my product. You took my payment. Not happy at all.
PupSocks,2021-01-08T23:58:49Z,1,"Ordered Nov.16, stopped getting updates on my package Dec.21. Emailed 2 times asking for information. Still have not heard from them, and still do not have my package."
PupSocks,2021-01-08T23:55:50Z,5,My husband loved his blanket! It has been well loved since we got it. It showcases our old pup who passed in April and our new pup!
PupSocks,2021-01-08T23:50:56Z,4,"Socks were cute and funny. However, they did not fit well. Bunched up quite a bit around the front of the ankle. They are a good gag gift."
PupSocks,2021-01-08T23:46:08Z,3,"The blanket itself turned out wonderful. The faces are clear, my husband loved it. I was frustrated however with how long it took to get the product. From when I ordered it, it spent near an entire month “in production”. And it came a full week after the expected delivery date. Which was both disappointing and frustrating, since it was a gift."
PupSocks,2021-01-08T23:37:48Z,5,I love the socks!!! Great quality and the picture was perfect. This was a gift and the recipient loved them too. I would definitely make another order again.
PupSocks,2021-01-08T23:36:44Z,1,"Super disappointed in Pupsocks right now. I ordered my socks on Nov. 27 (hoping to get them in time for Christmas) and it indicated they would arrive in 12-15 business days. Not only did my socks not arrive in time, there has been no update to where the socks are in transit. I have emailed customer service over 5 times asking for an update, only to receive a generic and unhelpful email from their president. I understand and empathize with it being COVID, however, they should not be telling customers that there orders will arrive in 12-15 business days, and then leave them in limbo after over a month of waiting for them to arrive. Hoping to get this situation rectified, as I do enjoy their products."
PupSocks,2021-01-08T23:36:19Z,1,Item never showed up and there has been no response to several emails to the company.
PupSocks,2021-01-08T23:12:45Z,4,"Product was of good quality and looks good; however, they were not received until January, well after Christmas. It would have been nice to have been notified prior to delivery."
PupSocks,2021-01-08T22:54:05Z,1,Ordered well in advance and still don’t have the socks. Might get them by 2022?
PupSocks,2021-01-08T22:52:59Z,5,I made these for 2 of my daughters and they absolutely loved them.
PupSocks,2021-01-08T22:49:53Z,1,"My order never shipped, and when I emailed customer support I got a generic response that was autofilled and never followed up onI will be requesting my money back through PayPalWorst Christmas gift idea ever"
PupSocks,2021-01-08T22:39:31Z,4,I ordered on Black Friday but only received the socks after Christmas :(Important to mention: I am from Germany
PupSocks,2021-01-08T22:36:31Z,1,Been waiting two months and they still haven’t arrived
PupSocks,2021-01-08T22:30:08Z,1,"Picture is great. The cut is terrible, no one in out house can wear them comfortably. They have no angle, just a rectangle sewn together."
PupSocks,2021-01-08T22:25:40Z,2,Still have not received my order. I made the order in november
PupSocks,2021-01-08T22:25:07Z,2,"I was so excited about gifting these socks as a Christmas present to my parents, and got their 3 pups' faces on them. But unfortunately the socks fit super weirdly (one pair is extremely tight across the top of the feet, while the other's heel is WAY farther back than it should be--both pairs are the same size and what my parents wear according to the Pupsocks size guide). Neither of my parents is likely to where them again, so it was a total bust of a gift. And an expensive one at that. The idea is so fun, but the execution needs to be much, much better for socks that cost this much! Definitely won't be buying again!"
PupSocks,2021-01-08T22:16:43Z,1,Ordered on November 27 2020 and still haven't received my order yet.
PupSocks,2021-01-08T22:11:55Z,2,Picture Quality is very nice. Colour is great. However very disappointed in the size Of the mask itself. Hardly covers enough of an adults face. Also the elastics are loose and aren’t adjustable. I would not recommend until size increased and toggles added. Plus took almost 2 mths to arrive in Canada!!
PupSocks,2021-01-08T22:05:09Z,4,Great products and customer service. Better expectations on what the image would look like would be better. Thank you.
PupSocks,2021-01-08T21:39:40Z,2,"I sent an email 10 days ago about not receiving half my order and  receiving someone else’s order, this has not been resolved nor have I heard from anyone yet. You have no posted customer service number I can call only email.  Yet you send me  a review email?"
PupSocks,2021-01-08T21:36:40Z,4,"Love the end product, also love the mock up of the end product which is sent by email. Delivery took a while though and unfortunately didn't get here until after Christmas, despite being ordered in November."
PupSocks,2021-01-08T21:29:45Z,3,"The picture on the socks turned out great and the socks are super cute. The fit of the socks, however, is terrible.  The fit around the ankle/bend of the foot is way too tight with no give and then the sock is shapeless in the foot so it’s baggy.  My son was super excited to wear his socks and can’t. It’s an expensive gift to not be able to use. Super cute idea but sock design definitely needs some work."
PupSocks,2021-01-08T21:25:32Z,1,"The pictures came out better than expected on the socks.  However, the material is very cheap; feels like 100% poly.  The shape of the sock is also incredibly square.  I feel confident in saying no one's foot (or ankle or calf for that matter) is this shape."
PupSocks,2021-01-08T21:22:15Z,1,"I was sent a review before I received my product, which is weeks late (I ordered them on Black Friday) I understand there are increased production safety measures Etc, but then 1. don’t guarantee delivery by Christmas and 2. simply update your customers. I had to inquire as to why I hadn’t received my products myself. Still waiting on them! I’m sure they’ll be cute when I get them."
PupSocks,2021-01-08T21:17:58Z,5,Perfect gift! They look great!
PupSocks,2021-01-08T21:13:00Z,1,Still have not received my item and I ordered well before Christmas
PupSocks,2021-01-08T21:10:39Z,2,"I ordered one blanket and one mask for my kids for Christmas. The blanket took a month to get, and the mask never even arrived."
PupSocks,2021-01-08T21:06:44Z,1,Extremely late delivery
PupSocks,2021-01-08T21:06:30Z,1,I’m still waiting for socks ordered early November
PupSocks,2021-01-08T21:04:23Z,5,"Got these for my brother and sister-in-law's with their cats' faces. I told them my friends wanted to see their cats, and the pics they sent were hilarious. They were so surprised by the socks and loved them! Great Christmas present!"
PupSocks,2021-01-08T21:04:17Z,3,Update: I received my order on 1/9. Socks we good quality and looked good. Rating is down since it took 44 days to receive my orderI ordered for 3 sets of pup socks on November 26th and have not received my order yet. My order has not been sent to the USPS. I believe this place to be a scam. Order product at your own risk. I have sent 3 emails to get updates and have not received anything other than a canned message blaming USPS.  My order has not been received by the USPS. This is strictly a PUPSOCKS issue.
PupSocks,2021-01-08T20:59:26Z,1,"It's hard to leave a review on something you've never received, even close to 2 months after ordering. Needless to say I will not be ordering from you again, no matter how cute the socks are."
PupSocks,2021-01-08T20:57:12Z,1,I sent in a picture of my dogs and asked them to only do the white dog on the left and they sent socks with the brown dog that was on the right.. I was very specific in my instructions as well.
PupSocks,2021-01-08T20:38:39Z,5,Wife absolutely loves the socks you did an excellent job
PupSocks,2021-01-08T20:31:56Z,1,"I ordered socks well before Christmas, and was advised through their website I would receive them before Christmas, and it is now January 8th and I have still not received them. I have emailed them to ask about their whereabouts and they have not responded to me.  I was waiting to complete the review to see if they would respond,  but have given them ample of time to do so and, therefore, can not recommend them."
PupSocks,2021-01-08T20:27:43Z,1,"Product was so bad, material so cheap. Would not ever recommend or order again"
PupSocks,2021-01-08T20:23:51Z,1,They took forever to ship. Missed Christmas and I ordered on November 27. Received in January. The quality is a $2 pair of socks. Not $25. Don’t buy!!
PupSocks,2021-01-08T20:16:35Z,5,"The prices are great, given the time I ordered the shipping was quick the design is amazing. I ordered a size to small I guess because their a little tight :( other than my mistake everything is perfect"
PupSocks,2021-01-08T20:15:41Z,2,Very slow shipping and lack of communication on items location.
PupSocks,2021-01-08T20:13:52Z,2,"The design was great but the sizing was way too big. I bought these for my partner, basing what to choose on her shoe size, and these socks don't fit her foot well at all, to the point that she doesn't want to wear them."
PupSocks,2021-01-08T20:12:35Z,5,"Such a cute idea!  I bought them as gifts for my sister, daughter and niece, all who have exceptional pups!  They not only liked the idea of the personalization, but they thought they were super comfy!"
PupSocks,2021-01-08T20:11:57Z,1,Order took one month to deliver & we never received because we could not update our address.
PupSocks,2021-01-08T20:10:20Z,1,Waited weeks for the mask I ordered and the mask was way too big and didn't fit. I am a 200 lb 6ft tall male. Mask found the garbage pretty quick.
PupSocks,2021-01-08T20:08:40Z,1,I have not received my item and no one responds to my inquires. It has been over two months.
PupSocks,2021-01-08T20:08:37Z,1,"Absolutely awful. I sent in an order and wrote in their request box what I wanted the socks to look like. They did the exact opposite of what I requested. I sent an email to complain and they responded with one email and never offered to help in anyway. I will never, ever, ever, order from them again. Terrible product and even worse service."
PupSocks,2021-01-08T20:05:00Z,2,I haven’t even got both products. The socks didn’t look like what the picture portrayed and I have no clue about the blanket..I am very unhappy about the whole experience
PupSocks,2021-01-08T19:59:51Z,2,"My dog's photo looks great on the socks but they are really bad quality, and do not fit like normal socks. Basically a tube of fabric shaped like a sock."
PupSocks,2021-01-08T19:58:10Z,2,"While the end product was fine, the customer service was horrible. I placed my order on 11/27/20. One item, a face mask. I received my order on 01/02/21. I received one email from the company that entire time. I used the tracking number in that email to check in periodically on my order. Every time I did, it said my order was “in production.” I sent at least two emails to customer service and received no response.Recognizing we are in the midst of a global pandemic I waited until a week before Christmas to get really annoyed. Then I took to social media where I discovered posts from the company about shipping issues with the USPS. However, my order still said in production. I messaged customer service on Instagram and Facebook and received no response. I was at the point of canceling my order when I finally received notice it shipped over a month after the order was placed. The USPS managed to deliver the package without issue in about three days. If a human had just honestly responded to me about the status of my order I wouldn’t be writing this review, and I’d probably order from pupsocks again. But, since there was zero customer service, I will not be using pupsocks again."
PupSocks,2021-01-08T19:55:03Z,2,"These socks are cute, but that is where my good review ends.  They are cheaply made nylon tube socks. I bought a pair for myself and my family members. Due to the lack of comfort, not one of us will be wearing these socks.  Great idea but poor quality, sadly."
PupSocks,2021-01-08T19:53:25Z,1,I only received a partial order.  I ordered two pup blankets and only received one in the packaging- although the tracking was for both.  There is no customer service number available to lodge a complaint- all you can do is email.  I have sent multiple emails with zero response back other than an automated email.  Terrible customer service experience - I would not order from them again for this reason.  Paid for a blanket I ordered on December 16 and have not received to-date.
PupSocks,2021-01-08T19:51:02Z,4,"Love the socks. Great job! The trimming of the photos was done very well. Exactly what we were hoping for. The shipping took quite a long time despite the promise that they would be to us by Christmas (in the ads), so why it's only a 4-star. Likely this could have been due to the pandemic - but then you shouldn't advertise that it will get to people by Christmas during a pandemic when EVERYTHING is delayed."
PupSocks,2021-01-08T19:44:11Z,3,"Took over 5 weeks to deliver, understandable during the covid crisis though. The printed images came out clear & great.  The fabric of the sock however is like cardboard and quite lacking.   Over all ""meh"" product for the high price."
PupSocks,2021-01-08T19:36:54Z,5,They were perfect and SUPER CUTE!!
PupSocks,2021-01-08T19:31:49Z,1,"I placed my order on Nov 24 as a Christmas gift, thinking it would allow plenty of time for delivery - shipped on Nov 28. However, my order arrived in Montreal on Dec 14th and remained there until Dec 30th (after Christmas) when I got a notification that my order could not be delivered because the packaging was damaged. After dealing with Canada Post, the package arrived on January 5th with a USED JOE FRESH SWEATER inside. Clearly something must have happened to my package during transit and the socks I ordered were replaced with something else that was lying around.I am not pinning my experience directly on this company but I have reached out to them twice, on Dec 23 and Jan 2, and have received no response. I would either like my money back or another order fulfilled. Either way, their customer service is non-existent."
PupSocks,2021-01-08T19:31:29Z,4,"My daughter loves them. She thinks they are so cute; however, she says the material is a bit different. Other than that she really likes them."
PupSocks,2021-01-08T19:25:32Z,5,They did a great job cropping the pictures to go on the socks. Fast service
PupSocks,2021-01-08T19:24:17Z,2,"While the photo of our cat came out very well, the fabric of the socks is just plain weird and also uncomfortable. I tried to put them on but they just felt too binding and unlike any other socks I've ever worn.  I was super excited to receive these socks but they were not something I'd recommend."
PupSocks,2021-01-08T19:20:39Z,1,"I order 2 pairs of socks, they lost one and took over a month to ship the other. When they did arrive I was disappointed, they are made from a cheap material and the proportions make no sense. Tight around the ankle and to long in the toes."
PupSocks,2021-01-08T19:17:38Z,5,"My best friend lost her bulldog Bobo...I made a blanket for her. It is beautiful, thank you 💕"
PupSocks,2021-01-08T19:17:11Z,2,"Very slow shipping. It’s been 7 weeks and my package is still in Florida, I’m in Montreal..."
PupSocks,2021-01-08T19:16:08Z,4,"The blanket is super soft and most of the pics turned out great  ( I chose 4 and one is a little dark). Other than that, it is great! Only other thing is their delivery was slower than advertised but it was Christmas time so that may have had something to do with it. Overall, I highly recommend!"
PupSocks,2021-01-08T19:13:50Z,1,"After placing the order, I was told that it was being processed(11/27/20). Over two weeks later( 12/13/20) I was told that they had to remake the order without explanation why. I did not receive the order until after January 1,2021. This was to be a Christmas gift. I don't believe shipping was the issue but internal process issue. I would have expected some compensation but there was none."
PupSocks,2021-01-08T19:12:54Z,1,2 months and still have not received
PupSocks,2021-01-08T19:12:01Z,1,"My item was lost in the mail. Received an empty package that was ripped open. This isn’t pupsocks fault, but what is their fault is no response to my email notifying them that this happened."
PupSocks,2021-01-08T19:07:20Z,1,There was incredibly poor communication through this entire process. The socks are of incredibly poor quality and insanely overpriced for what you actually get.Great ideaTerrible execution Would not recommend to friends after dealing with this company.
PupSocks,2021-01-08T19:05:40Z,1,"I ordered in early December and still haven't received my order, I don't know if I'll ever. And no response from customer service."
PupSocks,2021-01-08T19:04:11Z,2,"Ordered a set of PupSocks for a friend in November. I received them first week of December, and they looked great! I noticed however, the socks were a little large for the person receiving them. I'm assuming the socks just ran a little large and this was my fault. With Christmas quickly approaching, I figured I would eat the cost due to my mistake and order a second pair (she could give the socks to someone with a larger foot) in time for Christmas. When I received the second pair of socks (the next size down) they were identical to the previous socks. The label on the tag didn't even have a size to verify if I received the smaller size like requested. The socks look great, which is why I'm giving 2 stars, but PupSocks really burned me on this order. I'm out whatever the cost was (I think $45-50) and done with PupSocks. If you're reading this, maybe get a blanket or something that can't be screwed up."
PupSocks,2021-01-08T18:55:35Z,1,We are still waiting for our order that was placed in November.
PupSocks,2021-01-08T18:55:27Z,1,"I ordered two pairs of socks the middle of November. Shipping showed up to 15 business days for international. They should have arrived in the beginning of December. It took the company 9 days from the time I ordered them to the time they even started producing them. By the time they shipped them, delivery for Christmas was not even an option. Tracking was a week and a half behind. The socks arrived the week after Christmas and they were supposed to be a present.  Every time I wrote in I would receive a response back saying it would take up to 72 hours to get a reply and then I never did. I've requested a full refund three times and each time got a response  saying ""here's your tracking information"" and not any acknowledgement of what I was actually saying.  Three weeks after Christmas, I received another email saying here's your tracking information even though I received the socks last week. I will never buy from this company again, regardless of the quality of the socks. HOW I was treated as a customer is unappropriate and that is more important to me than the product."
PupSocks,2021-01-08T18:53:59Z,1,Socks are not what I expected.  The photo cropping was too severe and exactly what I asked not to do in the instructions on the order.  Photo reproduction was not great.  Shipping was a mess and very stressful.  So disappointed in this product.
PupSocks,2021-01-08T18:41:37Z,3,Don't know enough to review.  Ordered the socks 11/27/20.  Haven't received them yet on 1/8/21.
PupSocks,2021-01-08T18:39:02Z,1,I ordered a pair of sock for my son as surprise for Christmas.  He had a new adorable puppy.  The socks arrived on time but they had someone else's grey cat on them.  I tried multiple times and ways to get in touch with someone at PupSocks. I asked for a refund and for them to send my son the correct socks.    I never received a return call or email.  I did not receive a refund as well.  I would not recommend this company. They did not respond to my repeated attempts to try to make this right.  Bad Business practices!!!
PupSocks,2021-01-08T18:36:46Z,5,"Nothing better than giving your kid a mask with her two favorite things: money and her dog.  Price was good, quality is there.  Nice work"
PupSocks,2021-01-08T18:34:09Z,1,I never received it. I emailed letting them know it didn’t arrive and did not get a reply.
PupSocks,2021-01-08T18:29:38Z,1,Company has not responded my emails and I never received my package still trying to get money back. Dont recommend!!!
PupSocks,2021-01-08T18:29:10Z,3,"So I love this idea and it's so cute having a blanket with our dog's face all over it for sure, but I was disappointed in the turn around. The website claimed that it would produce and ship in one day. Understanding its Christmas time and covid has more parcels etc...we were anticipating a long shipping time. What we didnt anticipate was that our item wasnt shipped for 14 days. We ordered on nov.27th and it finally was shipped out on the 9th of December. Not what the website says. For the actual product, its adorable! There are some yellowish streaks on the blanket but only seen in a bright light. The pictures look great and the blanket is super soft. All in all I would order again but with a time buffer."
PupSocks,2021-01-08T18:26:52Z,2,Poor quality. Cute concept though. These took over a month to get which was disappointing also.
PupSocks,2021-01-08T18:23:00Z,5,Socks looked great.
PupSocks,2021-01-08T18:21:26Z,1,Never received my order
PupSocks,2021-01-08T18:21:04Z,5,I ordered 2 blankets for my son and daughter with their dog's faces. They are very cute. This was a surprise gift and they love them.
PupSocks,2021-01-08T18:18:30Z,1,"Incorrect Socks ReceivedI placed an order, received socks in an appropriate time frame, but the wrong custom socks were delivered.  I have reached out via customer service but have yet to receive a response on how they plan on rectifying this issue."
PupSocks,2021-01-08T18:17:59Z,5,"Socks were holiday gifts for friends. Quick turnaround, looked great and they loved them. Highly recommend!!!"
PupSocks,2021-01-08T18:17:23Z,1,"I have two orders that I have yet to receive (one being from a month and a half before Christmas and another shortly before Christmas Eve. I am thoroughly disappointed. No email, I even tried reaching out on Instagram and no one has ever gotten back to me. Very unfortunate.Update: I received the one pair today that I ordered six weeks ago, and the quality is not great at all. The socks are stiff and feel more like a tea towel than a sock. Definitely not worth the money I paid for them."
PupSocks,2021-01-08T18:17:03Z,1,The quality of the socks is horrible and the printer ink is nowhere near the color of the photo I uploaded.  I'm bummed that I spent money on these especially during a pandemic. :(
PupSocks,2021-01-08T18:12:13Z,5,Well above my expectations.
PupSocks,2021-01-08T18:11:57Z,5,"Good quality, and the wife was in tears when she got them!! She loves them!!!"
PupSocks,2021-01-08T18:05:17Z,1,"I ordered a pair of socks for my sister for Christmas (I had them sent directly to her because we were apart for Christmas this year), and when she opened them, they were very clearly someone else's order (two dogs, not my sister's cat...)! I sent PupSocks a message on their platform, and it has been marked as received, but I haven't heard anything back from them regarding replacing the purchase with the order I actually made!I get that Christmas is a super busy time of year, but it's been two weeks since I've reached out and I've gotten nothing."
PupSocks,2021-01-08T18:03:21Z,4,Socks were cute but were way bigger than the size chart estimated.
PupSocks,2021-01-08T18:02:28Z,5,Socks were adorable. My sister loved them.
PupSocks,2021-01-08T18:01:02Z,1,Not worth the cost
PupSocks,2021-01-08T18:01:00Z,5,The product was amazing. I was so pleased with the quality of the blanket and the how the photo came out. The blanket was so soft. My sister loved the gift. It did take a very long time to get it. Just over a month from order to receiving it. I was very pleased with this gift even though it ended up coming late. I would order it again. Just leave yourself lots of time before you need it.
PupSocks,2021-01-08T18:00:23Z,1,"The socks are cute but unwearable. The pictures turned out great but the cut and fit of the socks are terrible.  The socks are extremely baggy in the toe area, and the heel is so weirdly designed it wrinkles and bunches in both the front and back. I have emailed the company to no response, however I know they are very busy with delivery delays. I cannot recommend a sock purchase from this company unfortunately."
PupSocks,2021-01-08T17:59:19Z,5,The order came and was perfect. I want to order more. We had a blanket and socks made with my boy Chaplin who had just passed away from Lymphoma. It is so special to have the blanket keep me warm with his beautiful face as it reminds me of our snuggles.
PupSocks,2021-01-08T17:58:41Z,1,I never received my order
PupSocks,2021-01-08T17:53:52Z,1,"I had ordered a pair of blue socks with a black lab on them, however, what arrived were a pair of pink socks with a brown pug on them. I have reached out to the PupSocks team multiple times and no one has responded to me which is even more frustrating."
PupSocks,2021-01-08T17:52:05Z,1,"These socks are poor quality and do not fit... not even close!The picture is fun as a novelty, but the socks cannot actually be worn."
PupSocks,2021-01-08T17:51:57Z,4,"Socks are high quality materials and pictures are clear and recognizable. Shipping was delayed before Christmas (which was explained and expected) but as a result I was offered a deep discount on a subsequent order. So, great customer service! I received production emails during the process as well. The only reason I am not rating 5 stars is because I think the sizing chart is off. My socks ran very small. I sized up when I ordered just in case, but they were still too small. I am ordering a second pair two sizes larger than suggested by their guidelines in the hopes that they fit better."
PupSocks,2021-01-08T17:51:24Z,5,My aunt and cousin LOVED getting socks with their very own kitties on them. A great gift.
PupSocks,2021-01-08T17:51:15Z,1,I ordered custom socks mid November.. it’s now Jan 8 and nothing has arrived.. I’ve sent 3 unanswered emails to them asking for help and to reissue my order and no one even responds
PupSocks,2021-01-08T17:50:46Z,5,"My husband and I love our blankets! They are super soft and super cute. One of our faces was a bird and I wasn’t sure how it would turn out, but pupsocks nailed it! Our cat and dog were also perfect. My only disappointment was that they weren’t randomly scattered but in lines - the larger blanket had two columns of each face, so the left 1/3 was one face, middle 1/3 was one face and right 1/3 was the last face. But we still love them and definitely recommend this for every pet lover!"
PupSocks,2021-01-08T17:50:23Z,5,Always good quality and fits comfortably.
PupSocks,2021-01-08T17:48:53Z,1,"First I received a wrong item with someone's dog photo, instead of our cats. Then they told me the correct order will come right away and it never did."
PupSocks,2021-01-08T17:46:19Z,2,"The socks are adorable, and the picture, color and clarity are perfect!  However, sadly, they do not fit the recipient. He is an average sized man and they will not pull up onto his calf. The foot portion seems to be fine, but they are unwearable."
PupSocks,2021-01-08T17:45:04Z,1,Still waiting for my order Placed November 24???
PupSocks,2021-01-08T17:41:50Z,5,What a great company to keep us posted on what is going on during these trying times and fixing orders in a very timely manner
PupSocks,2021-01-08T17:41:01Z,4,The photo that I had sent in of our sweet little kitten had a cropped ear which I hadn't noticed until after I made my order. Pupsock rounded out her ear so it looks like she has 2 round perfect ears! I am so impressed with the quality of these socks and plan on ordering again.
PupSocks,2021-01-08T17:37:11Z,5,"Pup socks are the best! Easy ordering, fast shipping and great product!"
PupSocks,2021-01-08T17:33:21Z,5,These turned out great and were shipped out very quickly! They were a fun gift to give.
PupSocks,2021-01-08T17:31:12Z,1,"The socks we received had a picture of a random cat instead of the one I submitted.  Contacted customer support and received no response.  The socks are also a weird material, more like compression socks than normal socks"
PupSocks,2021-01-08T17:28:40Z,1,Never received my product. Want refund
PupSocks,2021-01-08T17:28:39Z,5,"I ordered over Christmas and because the post office was backed up, they sent me an amazing mock up of my design to show the person receiving the gift.  The socks arrived shortly after Christmas and the quality was amazing.  Very happy with this company, thank you!"
PupSocks,2021-01-08T17:26:06Z,1,Terrible image...they did not follow the “artists notes” and I have yet to receive a response from customer service and and its been 2 weeks!
PupSocks,2021-01-08T17:24:26Z,2,"I am STILL waiting for them to arrive in the mail! So I cannot comment on the product, only the very slow shipping."
PupSocks,2021-01-08T17:21:25Z,3,took too long to arrive-received after xmas and was ordered 6 weeks before
PupSocks,2021-01-08T17:20:56Z,1,Still waiting for order placed 11/30/20. Very disappointed ☹️
PupSocks,2021-01-08T17:20:38Z,5,The shipping was a nightmare!! But still 5 stars! These are so well done my wife loves them! The picture of our dog is great and the socks are high quality. Definitely will buy these again. Glad they came!!!
PupSocks,2021-01-08T17:18:38Z,4,"The order was late, but thus understandable in 2020. The masks were not centered to show all 4 of our cats. 2 of them are cut in half. The blankets are nice although the colors are off from the photos. I’m still very happy."
PupSocks,2021-01-08T17:17:43Z,4,"Nice picture socks novelty price a wee high, but made a good gift"
PupSocks,2021-01-08T17:16:37Z,1,We placed the order in nov 2020 with a expected delivery date of 12-15 days.  As of Jan 8 2021 we have still not received our order.
PupSocks,2021-01-08T17:16:34Z,2,"The website was unclear on how to use 1 picture with 2 faces on it. When you pick 2 faces it asks for 2 pictures. I was forced to use 1 picture and then explain in the comments to use the 2 faces. There was no option to use 2 faces in one picture and be charged for 2 pictures so the tech would only use 1 picture.You need to add 1 more payment option of: 1 picture with 2 faces.... actually you should add 1 picture with 3 and 4 faces.Also...from a design standpoint and especially for Christmas, why not use Christmas balls as the frame for the pictures to sit is with a soft edge to the pictures?"
PupSocks,2021-01-08T17:15:52Z,1,"Ordered a pair of socks on November 27. Still haven’t received it, I live in Montreal, Canada. I wrote you a few days ago, hoping you could give me information about the tracking of the parcel but no answer as of today.  I know it is not your fault if there’s delay but at least a response would have been nice. My parcel is at Miami airport since December 17, according to USPS tracking website. Lucie"
PupSocks,2021-01-08T17:14:56Z,1,"I ordered two pairs of socks on black Friday, 11/27/20. They were to be Christmas gifts. I received them on January, 5th. None of my emails sent to customer service were answered. I did not know if I would ever see them. Experience was awful. Ridiculous. I will be having a local company make personalized gifts for me in the future."
PupSocks,2021-01-08T17:13:32Z,4,"Got my order in Norway with some delay, but understandably due to covid.I was happy to offer it as a gift and it was a fun gift as I had intended.My only observation is that the quality of the fabric could be better."
PupSocks,2021-01-08T17:13:21Z,1,The package I received was ripped open and the socks were not inside. I emailed back about getting new socks and the company said no
PupSocks,2021-01-08T17:12:51Z,1,The print came out good but the socks were just terrible. I get why the material needed to be like that but no one’s feet are shaped the way the socks came out. I was gifting them to my girlfriend and she hated them. Unfortunately I will not be a returning customer.
PupSocks,2021-01-08T17:12:38Z,1,I placed 2 different orders in November for Christmas gifts.  We are mid January and I still don’t have them.  Pup socks won’t respond to me I’ve sent messages.   It’s brutal.
PupSocks,2021-01-08T17:11:40Z,1,If I could give less than one star I would.  How dare you ask for a review before I even received my order. An order I placed in November 2020.  It’s 2021 now.
PupSocks,2021-01-08T17:10:51Z,1,I am sure you have seen the thousands and thousands of social media posts about the level of customer service of PupSocks. An order placed on November 27 and I still haven't received it in Calgary is beyond disappointing. It went from a few COVID excuses to now just ignorance on your team's level of customer service. We still wait for our socks and am hoping that your company isn't a scam. It is funny that every other company adapted to COVID and didn't use COVID as an excuse. I am pretty sure that the wealth of bad reviews on trustpilot and they keep increasing will adversely affect your company's long term viability.  I think you will look back and understand that honesty is always the key.Here's what I would recommend in the future - before December 24 (first time your company communicated) - communicate on a weekly basis. Don't make excuses except to say that we sold way more than we thought we would - we will not be able to deliver what we promised we would so we are sending you a refund on your shipping or something like that. Just stop making excuses on COVID or blaming the USPS - the reality is that my socks did not go into production for 3 weeks. That is on you and not USPS or COVID.My hope was that when the socks arrived (finally today January 8) that they are great and we will forget the hassle of an order placed on Black Friday and not delivered till January. This is just bad business and there is a consequence to it.I would love for your owner to simply admit that they dropped the ball to all of their customers or I am not sure the bad reviews will stop and the consequence will be to your business in the long run.I should have read reviews before I purchased - that is on me. I wish I would have because I would have taken my business somewhere else.  The sock pictures are fun - they would have been a ton of more fun if they came before Christmas like they were promised.  The quality of the sock is what I expected because they are a novelty one.  I am just disappointed.
PupSocks,2021-01-08T17:10:47Z,1,"Customer service is non responsive.   Tracking of item purchased almost two months ago and can’t be found.   Picture was ok, but asked to crop against the face and didn’t."
PupSocks,2021-01-08T17:10:37Z,1,"Ordered November 26, said it would take 8-10 days, still haven’t received my order! Very disappointing as it was a Christmas gift . Poor customer service"
PupSocks,2021-01-08T17:10:33Z,1,been waiting since end of november and still nothing has been received
PupSocks,2021-01-08T17:09:43Z,1,I never received my order. Contacted customer service by email and still have not heard back. My order was placed 6 weeks ago.
PupSocks,2021-01-08T17:08:05Z,5,Bought for a family member and they absolutely loved them
PupSocks,2021-01-08T17:07:57Z,2,"The socks did not show up in time for Christmas, ordered November 27th - they were a gift for my daughter. I assume this was due to shipping delays with Covid. When the socks did arrive, they were cute, but odd shaped (very large in the toes) and the material was not soft or comfortable. I would not rate this experience good at all for the price / quality and time it took to receive."
PupSocks,2021-01-08T17:06:20Z,5,Socks are great.  Shipping was a little slow but other then that all good.
PupSocks,2021-01-08T17:06:00Z,1,I don't know what too rate as I still have not received my order .... I do understand that it was Christmas and covid but we are going on a month ... Here's to hoping its still coming
PupSocks,2021-01-08T17:04:43Z,5,Great quality and they were done and shipped so quickly during the holiday rush~
PupSocks,2021-01-08T17:03:29Z,5,Awesome! Thanks guys!
PupSocks,2021-01-08T17:03:21Z,1,I ordered these socks on November 27th and still have not received them. You may want to coordinate your customer survey with the arrival of the product...
PupSocks,2021-01-08T17:02:35Z,3,"The product is good, despite I imagined smaller faces. The issue concerns the delivery which took over a month! It did not respected what claimed before ordering the blanked. It was a Xmas gift which obviously arrived 2 weeks later, despite having it ordered by time and staying at the website it should have arrived on the 22nd."
PupSocks,2021-01-08T17:02:02Z,1,"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY! The images shown on the site are NOT what you receive.  Looks like normally shaped socks (""L""shaped, with a heal).  What comes is a flat- ""tube sock"" which does not conform to the human foot.  Toe and heal are merely ""printed on"" with black ink.  Product does not fit the foot well, is not comfortable, and the fabric bunches up at the top foot ('Talus' area-where foot meets the end of the leg).  Ordered early November (hoping to use as stocking stuffers). Did not receive them until 1/2/21. Company blamed the USPS/pandemic but I received orders from other companies via USPS on time.  Whole experience was disappointing."
PupSocks,2021-01-08T17:01:06Z,5,Recipients loved their personalized masks!
PupSocks,2021-01-08T17:00:38Z,5,Brought true joy to my granddaughter.
PupSocks,2021-01-08T17:00:27Z,1,"I have purchased PupSocks once before, and they were great.  This time, sorry to say, the socks were oddly shaped (almost as if they were made for a duck's webbed feet!), had weird seams along the sides, didn't fit well (tight around the ankles but too wide at the toes), and were uncomfortable to wear.  The only redeeming feature was the picture of my adorable dog, which came out well.  I will not purchase any more PupSocks.  Too bad, since PupSocks used to be a great product."
PupSocks,2021-01-08T17:00:06Z,4,"Product is great, and my daughter loves her blanket. The delivery was very late, however."
PupSocks,2021-01-08T16:59:53Z,1,"I have been asked to write a review and wouldn't have written once unless asked. I ordered a pair of socks and a mask for a Christmas gift on November 27, 2020 and I have not received the delivery yet. I do live in Oakville, ON Canada so maybe that's the reason? I don't know.Still waiting, hopefully the wait is worth it."
PupSocks,2021-01-08T16:59:34Z,3,I waited over 2 months for my order and then when I received them they were HUGE for my kids.  😓
PupSocks,2021-01-08T16:57:26Z,2,product image was fine but socks felt terrible and shipping took over a month and missed the guaranteed delivery date by a week ruining my christmas gift for my grandmother
PupSocks,2021-01-08T16:57:14Z,1,I ordered 3 pairs and only 2 of the pairs were correct.  The 3rd pair was another dog that wasn't ours!
PupSocks,2021-01-08T16:56:42Z,1,I got something completely different that what i ordered...
PupSocks,2021-01-08T16:56:37Z,1,"Customer service was unresponsive, shipment was late and socks are not comfortable at all."
PupSocks,2021-01-08T16:55:43Z,5,Loved them!! Very well done!!! They were a Christmas gift and now my boyfriend won’t take them off! Thanks for making the holidays!!
PupSocks,2021-01-08T16:54:11Z,1,My order has yet to arrive. No tracking info. Both pup socks and ascendia have not provided an update. This was an Xmas gift for my fiancé and unfortunately I have zero information. Would to hear from someone so I do not have to initiate a chargeback. Calum McCullough
PupSocks,2021-01-08T16:53:57Z,5,"Great job, just what I needed"
PupSocks,2021-01-08T16:53:25Z,5,Love them. Got 2 for Christmas gifts.
PupSocks,2021-01-08T16:53:23Z,5,"I ordered a pair of socks for my fiancee for Christmas. Due to COVID, the original order never made it through USPS. Before I even had a chance, the team at Pupsocks proactively emailed me to say they were working on a replacement pair. While it didn't quite arrive on time, it was a great post-Christmas gift that my fiancee absolutely loved. I have nothing but good things to say about this company and would easily recommend it to anyone."
PupSocks,2021-01-08T16:51:36Z,4,I appreciate the design and the picture cut out were really well done! The quality of the sock itself was below what I expected though. They fit a bit weird and the front toes are literally just a square. But overall it was a unique gift to give.
PupSocks,2021-01-08T16:50:55Z,5,The socks were amazing! My daughter loved them for Christmas.
PupSocks,2021-01-08T16:50:35Z,2,"The socks were what we ordered, were adorable, and delivered quickly. However, the socks themselves are very strange. Weird, not stretchy material. Very wide at the toes, so there’s almost an inch hanging off on the sides. The ankle part is basically a straight tube and isn’t stitched to accommodate the bend of the ankle, so they bunch up on top. Overall, pretty disappointed in the socks and wish they fit better."
PupSocks,2021-01-08T16:49:56Z,4,The process was easy and service was fine.  The prints look great.  The quality of socks were disappointing.
PupSocks,2021-01-08T16:49:36Z,1,Cheap! Cheap! Cheap! Paper thin material. Hardly a sock. My daughter wasted all that money on these things. And the picture on the sock doesn’t even match our cat.
PupSocks,2021-01-08T16:49:30Z,2,"The time to ""produce"" these socks was nearly a month. When I ordered,  they promised delivery before Christmas. These arrived after the new year. The company blamed USPS for the delay. They didn't acknowledge they shipped these 2 days before Christmas and passed the buck. These socks are soft and as described, but the faces stretch the higher up the leg they go. It took Customer Service over a week to get back to me after multiple requests just to blame the post office. Had they acknowledged their part, I would've accepted the delay and been fine with these arriving late. Instead they blamed the post office on social media and in Customer Service requests."
PupSocks,2021-01-08T16:49:19Z,1,"I ordered this as a Christmas present - it arrived yesterday on the 7th Jan. When I tried to contact Pupsocks before Christmas to inquire about the shipment, they replied with an automated reply which was of no help at all! I will not be using this company again."
PupSocks,2021-01-08T16:48:13Z,1,"Pups looked great but the socks are unwearable. Odd texture. Really shiney and with no stretch, they feel like compression socks. No shape, just a non stretchy tube. Really synthetic. Just awful. Non of us will wear them.  CUte idea but a total waste of money."
PupSocks,2021-01-08T16:47:35Z,1,"I’m writing this revenue on January 8th, still having no idea if the socks I ordered in November will ever arrive. I loved the idea of socks with my dogs face on them, but unfortunately my order has never been fulfilled and I can not recommend this company."
PupSocks,2021-01-08T16:47:30Z,1,Package never arrived. Ordered it early December and they keep spamming me with email offers.
PupSocks,2021-01-08T16:47:02Z,1,"I still haven’t even received my order that was supposed to be a Christmas present that I ordered in the middle of November. I understand that things are delayed because of covid and whatever but I still haven’t seen it and we’re almost halfway through January. I just hope that when I do get it, it’s good quality or I’ll just be even more upset than I already am."
PupSocks,2021-01-08T16:45:18Z,1,I was not happy with my order as it took over a month to deliver and when it was delivered it was completely opposite of what I ordered. Wrong design on the socks and they put the wrong dog on them.
PupSocks,2021-01-08T16:44:35Z,5,I loved all of my products so much!!!! The print quality was worth the expense of my products and I would totally buy again! Thank you all
PupSocks,2021-01-08T16:43:57Z,4,Love the finished product.  Just too to long to receive.  Ordered in Nov and received on Jan 7.
PupSocks,2021-01-08T16:42:36Z,1,I ordered socks and got shipped the wrong ones. I ordered my cat and received someone’s dog. I had to send three emails to even get a response and since that response I have sent three additional emails and still have no solution. This process has been over a month now.
PupSocks,2021-01-08T16:42:18Z,1,"I never received the socks but my credit card was charged! This order was placed on 12/1/2020 and for weeks has been associated with a usps tracking number. However when I track the package through usps, the following message is displayed: “ Your package is on its way to a USPS facility. Sign up to get updates, and we'll send you a delivery date and time when available.” I hope Pupsocks will remedy this as I’m a very disappointed customer right now."
PupSocks,2021-01-08T16:41:38Z,1,Customer service great-product is terrible
PupSocks,2021-01-08T16:41:25Z,1,"PupSocks promised delivery within 15 days, it's been 1,5 months and the socks still haven't arrived. An attempt to contact PupSocks only lead to automated reply and no actual help. Avoid this company – this is the perfect example of bad management and false advertising."
PupSocks,2021-01-08T16:41:24Z,5,Product was excellent. Exactly what I wanted and great quality. Item was shipped promptly.
PupSocks,2021-01-08T16:40:46Z,1,No response from customer service. There is a hole and a run just putting them on. 2 emails sent
PupSocks,2021-01-08T16:37:54Z,5,This is a great company with great quality work! Memorable gifts!!
PupSocks,2021-01-08T16:36:52Z,1,I’ve yet to receive my order.  Placed an order on November 27th.  Still in transit.
PupSocks,2021-01-08T16:36:22Z,1,"This was a horrible experience! The socks I received had someone else’s dog on it!!!! I emailed you twice with no reply.What a bummer, I was excited to gift these and was out a good amount of money!Definitely would warn anyone wanting to purchase."
PupSocks,2021-01-08T16:36:16Z,5,"The socks came out perfect, looked just like my dog, an amazing gift!"
PupSocks,2021-01-08T16:36:08Z,1,"I waited over a month for delivery. Not only did I not get the socks by Xmas, but I received the wrong socks and I can’t reach anyone."
PupSocks,2021-01-08T16:35:27Z,4,"I love the blanket that I got. It's really cute and the detail of my cats' picture is amazing. The quality of the socks, though, is kinda weird. They're not really comfy. They're an odd material."
PupSocks,2021-01-08T16:35:10Z,1,"I hate to leave a bad review, but I was very disappointed with this experience. I ordered a blanket as a Christmas gift in November and it arrived after Christmas. I was understanding of this due to the season and strain on the postal system, but what we received was someone else’s order. I contacted the company through email from the purchase site and received a generic auto response stating that eventually someone would get to me because aparently they have a backlog of customer issues. It’s been almost 2 weeks now and still nothing. With tax and shipping this was a $70 purchase so some kind of response would be nice."
PupSocks,2021-01-08T16:32:22Z,4,"I will say they did take a long time to even ship the item, over a month, but they were very attentive and gave me 15% off for the hassle so. The mask I ordered was good quality too."
PupSocks,2021-01-08T16:31:01Z,1,"Reached out multiple times for a wrong and damaged order. Still have no received a response. You’d think for paying $30 for one pair of socks, the service would be a little better.."
PupSocks,2021-01-08T16:30:53Z,3,The socks are poor quality.  Definitely not worth the price.
PupSocks,2021-01-08T16:29:34Z,1,"Order still missingI still haven't received the items I ordered I'm afraid, after placing the order at the end of November."
PupSocks,2021-01-08T16:29:30Z,3,Print quality is good but the shape of the socks needs improving. I guess there is some technical requirement for printing but a strait tube shape socks don’t really fit a foot. Good funny gift thou.
PupSocks,2021-01-08T16:27:27Z,1,Still haven’t received my order...from 11/27/20.
PupSocks,2021-01-08T16:26:15Z,5,I ordered these socks for my nephew for Christmas picturing his dog and he loved them!!
PupSocks,2021-01-08T16:25:49Z,5,The socks are comfortable and the printed pictures appear to be high quality.
PupSocks,2021-01-08T16:23:49Z,5,"Fun product, good customer service"
PupSocks,2021-01-08T16:21:41Z,1,"I ordered my pup socks on Dec 2 nd. I just received notification that they have arrived. Today is January 8 th.  I do understand the postal issue but this is ridiculous. The order was not sent out until December 20th.  I sent an email to you re issue and got generic one back. Then I get this to review, very disappointed"
PupSocks,2021-01-08T16:21:28Z,5,good experience
PupSocks,2021-01-08T16:21:22Z,3,I’d love to give you a 5 but I have not received my socks or mask that I ordered in November.I’m so disappointed but still hoping I will receive them.
PupSocks,2021-01-08T16:20:55Z,1,Haven't received it. No communication from customer service.
PupSocks,2021-01-08T16:19:50Z,5,"Love my socks, and had a great customer service experience!"
PupSocks,2021-01-08T16:18:11Z,1,I need a refund and have emailed 5 times. My order was late after Christmas and you charged me for wrapping and it was not wrapped.  I'm outraged.  Please make It right.
PupSocks,2021-01-08T16:17:19Z,1,not answering my emails about my shipment.... are you a scam?
PupSocks,2021-01-08T16:15:41Z,1,I’ve still not received my product
PupSocks,2021-01-08T16:14:13Z,2,"Picture was nice, but socks are not comfy and are HUGE.  Not sure I can or will wear them."
PupSocks,2021-01-08T16:12:59Z,1,I order socks with 4 faces and when they final came which took a long time.  They only had 3 faces.
PupSocks,2021-01-08T16:12:07Z,5,Looks great and socks are of good quality. my girlfriend loved it.
PupSocks,2021-01-08T16:10:27Z,2,"It was ok for a “cute” gift, but they took over a month to arrive (didn’t make it for Christmas), and the sock itself is an odd shape. Its a rectangle, with no taper for the toes, and no shape for the heel, so it bunches up on the top of your foot. The printing quality was good, and it was a cute gift, but likely wont be worn as a practical, comfortable sock."
PupSocks,2021-01-08T16:08:38Z,2,I still haven't received my mask and my mock up was wrong they made it purple when it should be red
PupSocks,2021-01-08T15:59:11Z,1,"I placed an order back in November so my socks would arrive before the holiday.  I did not receive my order until yesterday, January 7th.  My socks were not even in the package!  I had sent a previous email inquiring about the status of my order that was never acknowledged.  I sent another email and message on your Facebook page after receiving the package yesterday.  I still have not been contacted.  This is ridiculous.  I will not order from you again and I recommend others do not either."
PupSocks,2021-01-08T15:59:01Z,3,"I’m pretty impressed. I ordered my socks in mid November as a Christmas gift for a family member. When it was getting closer to Christmas, I emailed customer service to see if my order was shipped, or manufactured, or what it’s status was, because there was no update on shipping yet. They emailed me back with an e-card of what the socks will look like and by that time, the tracking info was updated. On Christmas, I sent my family member the e-card of what she’d be receiving in lieu of the socks. One week into January, I received the socks and they’re so cute, and the animals are cropped well. However, the sock material itself is such poor quality and they’re actually not wearable. I can’t believe the price I paid for poor quality fabric.  I understand that shipping took so long due to international borders and covid but I’m still pleased with the service."
PupSocks,2021-01-08T15:54:40Z,5,Love this product!!!! I got exactly what I wanted!
PupSocks,2021-01-08T15:50:51Z,5,Cool product and GREAT customer service!!
PupSocks,2021-01-08T15:50:15Z,1,"Very dissatisfied with this product.  Sock itself is ill-fitting and cheap.  Image is poorly cropped, looks like a child did it.  Perhaps they were overwhelmed with the holiday rush, but this gift - which I had hoped would be special - turned out to be a complete dud.  Socks will never be worn."
PupSocks,2021-01-08T15:50:10Z,5,The socks were great. Good fit and comfortable.
PupSocks,2021-01-08T15:49:30Z,1,"Order was placed Nov 27 and as of January 8, it has still not been shipped. Poor communication from the company. Will never buy from them again!"
PupSocks,2021-01-08T15:47:24Z,1,"Still haven't gotten the socks I ordered on November 27th. I understand that that's on the USPS. However, I have sent four separate emails that have all gone unanswered and it appears that they are spending more time removing negative comments from their social media pages than responding to customers' emails. Additionally, maybe read the room and stop the constant advertising emails and those that request a review for a product that has not yet been received."
PupSocks,2021-01-08T15:46:15Z,1,My order came in wrong with the wrong animals printed on the socks. I spent $30 on these and they are incorrect. I have tried to contact support with no resolution. These were supposed to be a Christmas gift and are now just sitting in the closet.
PupSocks,2021-01-08T15:45:22Z,2,Product was ok but it took 5 weeks to arrive
PupSocks,2021-01-08T15:45:20Z,1,"Never received, spent a lot of money on 4 items. Unacceptable"
PupSocks,2021-01-08T15:43:16Z,4,"The socks are cute, however my daughter says they are not comfortable. For the price, they should be a bit more comfortable. I also did not like how you cut my cat's ears off in one of the photos......it looks funny."
PupSocks,2021-01-08T15:38:36Z,5,"Amazing work, thank you!"
PupSocks,2021-01-08T15:35:52Z,1,I waited 6 weeks to receive someone else’s order. I have contacted customer services and so far heard nothing back about my complaint.
PupSocks,2021-01-08T15:34:03Z,2,"I ordered these on November 25th and still have not received them.  I was told a replacement order would be placed, but did not receive a confirmation nor tacking for the replacement.   I know these are challenging times, but 6 weeks and still nothing?  Very disappointed."
PupSocks,2021-01-08T15:33:38Z,4,Production times were slower than expected. But product arrived and looked good.
PupSocks,2021-01-08T15:30:48Z,2,The socks are a great idea. And I wish the image wasn't so lost in the collage of them all over the socks. Maybe the light blue would have made a better choice. Other than that the socks were very cool.The part I was very displeased about was the whole purpose of getting them by Christmas as a gift. I was told they would be and then the shipping confirmation said it wouldn't be delivered till the 26th. And then another update to the 28th.
PupSocks,2021-01-08T15:29:11Z,1,"Terrible, ordered in November for Christmas and never received it. They had a big banner on top of their website saying all orders will be shipped next day, asked in regards to it in December and was told it was ""sent out"". I called the courier multiple times and they told me each time they never actually dropped off the package for them.I've sent countless emails and have not received any replies.Do not order from them."
PupSocks,2021-01-08T15:23:04Z,5,"Awesome products! A month or so before the Holidays I ordered 4 pairs - one each for my 2 kids with pics of our cat and dog (delivered to MD), one for my niece with pics of her dog and ME (delivered to FL) and one pair for my Mom, with 2 pics of ME (because I'm the favorite kid) (delivered to another location in FL)! They all arrived on time for us to have a Zoom call. Everyone opened them at the same time in three remote locations. They were a hit, probably the best gift I could have given everyone.NOTE: these socks run big so that keep that in mind when ordering."
PupSocks,2021-01-08T15:21:57Z,2,"The socks were cute and the pictures were great but my husband said they were not comfortable to wear, at all."
PupSocks,2021-01-08T15:18:18Z,1,I never received my product.
PupSocks,2021-01-08T15:16:14Z,1,I never got the socks !
PupSocks,2021-01-08T14:38:34Z,5,The socks are adorable!  And Pupsocks was very diligent about updates due to mail delays. I even got a mock up to share with the recipient!  Thanks pupsocks!!
PupSocks,2021-01-08T14:29:38Z,1,This was promised by Christmas and ordered in Nov.  Customer service was nonexistent and it only arrived after I took it to the resolution center at PayPal.  It arrived well into January.  I will never order from this company again.
PupSocks,2021-01-08T14:18:44Z,5,Everyone loved their puppies on the masks I sent them for Christmas gifts.
PupSocks,2021-01-08T14:14:07Z,3,"The socks were cute. However, I had ordered two faces, with one of them being larger than the other. They were not."
PupSocks,2021-01-08T14:10:18Z,5,I love them! I smile every time I see them!
PupSocks,2021-01-08T13:51:35Z,5,I purchased 2 pairs of socks and a blanket and they were a hit! Quick shipping and great quality!  Great way to have our precious pets with us all the time!
PupSocks,2021-01-08T13:41:39Z,1,"AVOID AVOID AVOID!! Check the comments on their Facebook ads.  They took hundreds of sales in November and December and have not fulfilled them.  My order was late November.  It’s now January 7 and in tracking it says “order received”.  Nothing has been done.  When you email them, they reply blaming it on the mail but they haven’t even started the order.  I have to now go to my credit card company to now have the order canceled and my money received.  DO NOT BUY FROM PUPSOCKS!"
PupSocks,2021-01-08T13:30:40Z,5,This was a gift for my 15 year old son. The dog is his and is getting old so I had this made. It’s a brilliant way (thank you) to keep the dog alive when he passes away. The blanket is very soft and the colors and pictures are vibrant. My only problem was how long it took to get here. Probably covid related that’s why I ordered it in early November. Thank you again. From one happy mama and her only son Debbie and Alex
PupSocks,2021-01-08T13:16:00Z,1,it's been more than 6 weeks.  still haven't received my order.  I asked for a refund but I got no answer whatsoever form customer's service. Dismal service
PupSocks,2021-01-08T13:06:59Z,1,I still have not received my package and I am unable to track it or look it up.My order was placed over a month ago.
PupSocks,2021-01-08T12:56:37Z,1,"My order has been lost and they have been of no help in locating it. No response to my emails except for a boilerplate response. Nothing. I wish I could review the product but it never arrived. Ordered on 12/7, was told it would arrive on 12/21."
PupSocks,2021-01-08T12:37:54Z,5,The order was awesome
PupSocks,2021-01-08T12:08:57Z,5,I’ve ordered several times for gifts and I have to say the biggest smiles happen when everyone opens their pup socks gift! The last order was a last minute gift and I was so pleased they arrived so fast. I really didn’t think I’d get them before the event since everything I’ve ordered other than from Amazon has had huge delays and in some instances I never received at all. I would highly recommend ordering from them especially if you want a gift that brings so much happiness.
PupSocks,2021-01-08T12:07:32Z,5,"Exactly as described, arrived on time."
PupSocks,2021-01-08T11:46:27Z,2,"While the product is very nice, very cute, and fun. The company is terrible with their communication and sent several conflicting emails. Got follow up email 5 days after I rec'd my order in response to an email I sent 15 days prior. Rec'd two shipping emails 5 days apart and the USPS didn't get it for another 6 days. The ""CEO + Founder"" sent a placating email and left it unsigned. Take ownership of your business and not have some flunky send out an unsigned apology, step and take the bad with the good. Ordered on 12/3 rec'd 12/31 on a product going from GA to MI.  Production was quoted as 3-5 business days. Couldn't even hit that time line. Hopefully the company has learned from this and taken steps to improve all aspects of the business from production forecasting and timing to communication and shipping. That being said, I would order again, just with a great deal more lead time unless the company can explain the changes they have made to improve their internal processes."
PupSocks,2021-01-08T11:39:16Z,5,"The socks look awesome! I got them to give as a Christmas gift, and the recipient was thrilled!"
PupSocks,2021-01-08T11:33:36Z,1,I ordered on Nov 26th and I still haven’t received anything. No updates on the shipping. Just nothing.
PupSocks,2021-01-08T10:58:01Z,1,"Order newer arrived after more then a month of waiting. No response from support team. No help, nothing, only money taken."
PupSocks,2021-01-08T10:31:31Z,1,They lost my socks in transit and have been very difficult to get in contact with. Don’t bother with this company.
PupSocks,2021-01-08T09:56:49Z,3,"I understand that everything is delayed with covid, but ive received other items from american in good time. I ordered my partner socks back in late November for a christmas present and i still don't have them. 😣"
PupSocks,2021-01-08T07:45:32Z,1,Sadly so disappointed! I was so excited for these. Poor quality. Socks received do not look like the images advertised. The design request wasn’t as requested. Either the wrong sizes were sent or their sizes are wildly large. I spent $100 on socks no one is going to wear.
PupSocks,2021-01-08T06:31:22Z,1,paid and ordered on the 27th of November !!!  Today 8th of January 2021 and still no information about where about my order is !!!
PupSocks,2021-01-08T06:21:39Z,5,I am giving pup socks 5 stars because when they got my order wrong they made it right and my husband loved his socks. Thank you for caring about your customers!
PupSocks,2021-01-08T06:01:01Z,1,My socks never arrived
PupSocks,2021-01-08T05:43:16Z,5,"I purchased a custom face mask and the quality was phenomenal. I was skeptical as I found the site through instagram, but I couldn’t have been more please with photo visibility of my pup on the mask  and the speediness of my product being shipped and delivered."
PupSocks,2021-01-08T05:42:00Z,5,The product was great but now I get an email from them every few days and I wish that would stop.
PupSocks,2021-01-08T04:53:06Z,2,Order items for Christmas-according to advertising I ordered in time for delivery at Christmas. Checked on ordered multiple times and it wasn’t until Christmas Eve when I was notified that it wouldn’t be there but to expect it in the next week. More than 2 weeks later it finally arrived.
PupSocks,2021-01-08T04:36:31Z,2,I ordered the socks and blanket on thanksgiving for a Christmas present for my daughter. Never got a shipping notice. Didn’t receive the order until December 31st. Blanket was cute. Material of socks was unusual and uncomfortable to wear. Will not order again.
PupSocks,2021-01-08T04:31:14Z,2,Ordered three blankets. First blanket was blue with a black and white dog. The white parts of his face were a shade of blue. Second blanket was pink with an all white dog. The white face was an orangey color. Third blanket was spot on. Ordered over a month prior to needing the blankets. Two of three blankets arrived prior to Christmas. First blanket was ordered before the other two and was the one that came days late. Was not shipped until 4 weeks after being ordered. Tracking number showed package label was created but not brought to post office for weeks. The first blanket I ever purchased a few years ago was amazing. Best purchase. Waited a long time for the blankets to come back. Disappointed with my products but obviously could not return in time to get new blankets for gifts.
PupSocks,2021-01-08T04:28:54Z,3,I received my package and it was not at all what I had ordered. I contacted the company but they never responded to my first email. I sent another follow up email with the same complaint and someone finally got back to me. I received a new pair at no extra cost and I didn’t have to worry about sending the first one back.
PupSocks,2021-01-08T04:26:00Z,1,"I am so frustrated! I ordered socks and blankets for my 2 daughters. My order was placed on 11/24/20. When I didn't receive my order, I emailed customer service on 12/18/20 to touch base and make sure my order would be here in time for Christmas. Customer service didn't even respond to my email until 1/5/21! Today is 1/7/21, and I have STILL not received my order. Terrible. This company obviously could care less about their customers. I understand we are all dealing with COVID, and I am sensitive to that. However, it would have taken about 1 minute to reply to my email on 12/18/20 and I would have respected whatever was going on with my order. Completely disappointed, angry, and frustrated."
PupSocks,2021-01-08T04:19:12Z,1,"Ordered socks as a Christmas gift for my partner. What turned up are unlike any socks I've received before, worst ""socks"" ever. There is indeed my dogs face on it, but the fit is horrible. They are essentially a one ended tube, a struggle to get on, and they don't seem like there was any effort to design them to fit the shape of a foot. You might as well brand them as mittens and sell them as that too. Seemed like a great gift, with proceeds to a good cause, but terrible, pretty much throw away quality. Very, very disappointed, definitely cannot recommend."
PupSocks,2021-01-08T04:11:57Z,1,I never received anything. This was supposed to be a Christmas gift. Quite disappointed just thought it was late
PupSocks,2021-01-08T04:10:48Z,5,Got the socks in a timely manner and they were great!
PupSocks,2021-01-08T03:54:10Z,5,Super cute! Got them as a gift and they loved it.
PupSocks,2021-01-08T03:44:52Z,4,"He loved the blanket. Did get it really late, but you responded quickly to my emails."
PupSocks,2021-01-08T03:42:39Z,1,Socks are not sewn correctly.  I ordered the week of Thanksgiving and didn't receive until after Christmas.
PupSocks,2021-01-08T03:13:29Z,1,"I bought those socks for my boyfriend, and we were very shocked to see that the socks don't even have a sock shape, there is no space for the heel. Also the fabric is very cheap."
PupSocks,2021-01-08T03:09:13Z,3,They’re cute but took way longer than they said to arrive.
PupSocks,2021-01-08T03:07:39Z,4,"We love the idea, but have you thought of making the socks more of a tub sock style as they might be a better fit, as the toe are seems quite ample also."
PupSocks,2021-01-08T02:58:16Z,1,waste of money. The sock material is very odd and so is the fit. They are basically too tight to even wear and there's no stretch in the material to help with that.
PupSocks,2021-01-08T02:57:42Z,5,Socks arrived quickly and were well done. The photos submitted were cropped perfectly and the final product exceeded expectations. They were a gift and I was told that they were comfortable. Would def order again.
PupSocks,2021-01-08T02:52:29Z,5,"Ordered two pair of the pupsocks for a Christmas gift. They were so cute and well made. The pictures on the socks were excellent quality, so I ordered another pair for me. Received my items before the estimated delivery time.Really great item especially for gift giving!"
PupSocks,2021-01-08T02:49:35Z,5,"Super adorable, and they shipped quickly! My boyfriend loved them"
PupSocks,2021-01-08T02:49:16Z,5,Great product and quality.  Perfect gift !!
PupSocks,2021-01-08T02:47:24Z,2,"The blanket was great in that the cat’s faces looked very sharp and it was very soft! I was mildly disappointed by the thickness of the blanket compared to the price though. However, I ordered before Thanksgiving and didn’t receive my order until after Christmas! The website said it would only take 8-10 business days. They say that if you email customer service you could expect a reply in 48-72 hours. The first time was 7 days to get a response and the second time emailed them it was 9 days. While I was fairly satisfied with the blanket, but because of the time it took to get it and the customer service I received, I will not order from them again."
PupSocks,2021-01-08T02:44:16Z,4,Update:  the blanket arrived today and it is so adorable!! I changed my review to a 4. It would be 5 if it hadn’t taken so long to arrive. Thank you. I would love to give you a 5 but we simply have never received our blanket. We ordered it on November 25th.  Fingers crossed it comes soon and we love it. Thank you
PupSocks,2021-01-08T02:43:30Z,1,My order never arrived and emails to customer service bounced back.
PupSocks,2021-01-08T02:42:03Z,5,This blanket was perfect! I bought it as a gift for someone for Christmas. It turned out exactly as I envisioned and she loved it.
PupSocks,2021-01-08T02:29:02Z,1,I have not received My package And I haven’t received the assistance to find it. I was expecting it for Christmas and I do not even know if you are a real store or not.
PupSocks,2021-01-08T02:16:11Z,1,Unfortunately I still have not received this order nor a reply to my email inquiring on its status.
PupSocks,2021-01-08T02:13:45Z,5,I sent a picture of my pet that I wasn’t exactly sure was going to work but the PupSocks designer did a fantastic job. I loved how the socks turned out. I wear them when I’m missing him and they make me smile😊
PupSocks,2021-01-08T02:09:16Z,5,Our blanket is amazing!! We love it so much.
PupSocks,2021-01-08T02:07:56Z,1,I ordered a pair of socks the day after Thanksgiving and received them a few days before Christmas. Just to receive an empty package and your lack of ways to get in contact with customer service is really irritating. I emailed stating what has happened and all I got was an automated answer. Nothing that y’all have recognized that I didn’t receive what I ordered. Not really satisfied with this.
PupSocks,2021-01-08T02:01:36Z,4,The socks were a big surprise. The recipient really enjoyed the products. Great service!
PupSocks,2021-01-08T01:42:45Z,5,I ordered a blanket as a Christmas present mid November. It didn’t come in time which was disappointing given I ordered well in advance however I realize a lot of that is out of their hands. The blanket itself is great. The pictures are clear and the blanket quality is awesome. Supper soft and a good size.
PupSocks,2021-01-08T01:40:03Z,1,Website claimed orders would be shipped prior to Christmas which they were not. I ordered mid way through November to try and avoid delays. I understand the current covid pandemic caused delays so I understood however when my order finally did arrive the socks did not have the correct picture on them rendering them useless.
PupSocks,2021-01-08T01:36:56Z,4,This was the perfect gift! The blanket is super soft and cute! The faces were a lot bigger than I expected but still looks great! I would definitely order from Pupsocks again!
PupSocks,2021-01-08T01:28:29Z,1,Finally received my order 3 weeks later than promised and it's incorrect. I've reached out to customer service on multiple platforms without a response.
PupSocks,2021-01-08T01:26:13Z,5,Socks were cute and made everybody laugh for joy to see the face of their beloved pet on them! Nice selection of colors.
PupSocks,2021-01-08T01:21:36Z,5,I ordered my boyfriend a pair as a christmas present with a pic of his dog as a puppy & he absolutely LOVES them!! Best present I have ever given!
PupSocks,2021-01-08T00:57:39Z,5,Because of COVID-19 I was affraid not to receive my socks in time for christmas  I was really happy on the 24th to receive an e-mail with a picture of my future gift with my daughter in law dog on it  Its a delicate attention Hopefully my socks arrive at the end of the 24 th and they are beautiful
PupSocks,2021-01-08T00:50:18Z,1,"made an order the 26 november and didnt receive anything yet, the website say max 15 business day, i send some email and don't have any honest answer, i really don't recommand buying anything from there"
PupSocks,2021-01-08T00:45:53Z,2,Cute sock but not made to be wearable.
PupSocks,2021-01-08T00:39:51Z,5,Loved it!  Second time we ordered and both were great. Don’t be fooled by those copycat companies. Their products suck and come from China!
PupSocks,2021-01-08T00:37:32Z,1,"Never received my purchased product. Multiple emails send inquiring the status as I was charged. Over a month and no response, have to claim the purchase as fraud with my bank. Horrible experience with a horrible company."
PupSocks,2021-01-08T00:33:01Z,1,Never got proof. Printed with out getting it right.  Sock size was huge.
PupSocks,2021-01-08T00:27:48Z,3,"I take responsibility for not having the socks the way I wanted. I sent this gorgeous picture of a cat but there was some lighting, I didn’t take in consideration. So the socks turned out like the cat was missing an eye. Again, totally my fault. I just thought it would be nice if they reached out and told me I sent a crappy pic but it was during the holidays and I’m sure they were extremely busy."
PupSocks,2021-01-08T00:21:39Z,1,Ordered dec 4 today is Jan 7 still not order but you took my money right away is this some kind of scam to rip people off ? My order # is 2483055 I want something done about this !!!!!!
PupSocks,2021-01-08T00:20:52Z,1,Month and a half and still have nothing.
PupSocks,2021-01-08T00:20:08Z,5,Good looking product and delivery was on schedule
PupSocks,2021-01-08T00:19:11Z,5,Enjoyed these products as Christmas gifts and made my family very happy.  Very well made and cute as can be.
PupSocks,2021-01-08T00:18:54Z,5,"Excellent product, very happy with the socks, they look great."
PupSocks,2021-01-08T00:09:46Z,5,"I ordered well in advance of the cut off for Christmas delivery, my order was listed as 'in production' for a long time, I realised it would not arrive in time and emailed to follow up about my order status. It took a couple of days to get a response however Pupsocks offered to refund part of my payment due to the delay, which I was happy with, and they even emailed a mock up of what the gifts looked like for me to print and give to the recipient on Christmas. Once my order arrived I was very happy with it, it looks great and they did a good job of cutting out the dogs' faces from my photo. Overall I recommend them as the product looks great and the customer service was good as well."
PupSocks,2021-01-08T00:08:53Z,1,HelloOrdered in nov 10 I believe and  just arrived yesterday Jan 6/21
PupSocks,2021-01-07T23:59:27Z,3,"Socks run larger than standard US sizes. Image quality was great. Customer service non-existent. Tracking number issued but no tracking available, still took 3 weeks to arrive."
PupSocks,2021-01-07T23:56:32Z,5,He kept talking about the great quality of the socks and loved his dog’s face all over them. Great Christmas gift! Arrived in time too.
PupSocks,2021-01-07T23:53:18Z,5,Made mum cry hahahahahahhaha
PupSocks,2021-01-07T23:52:46Z,2,Image was just ok as far as cropping.  Quality of socks and mask especially socks were poor.  Supposed to be kids sizes socks and the are huge.  Won’t be ordering again
PupSocks,2021-01-07T23:42:51Z,2,I’m only giving a poor review because I keep getting emails about rating my product but I haven’t even received it yet. I understand covid delays every thing but maybe put a stop to the never ending emails ? My order was placed at the end of November in hopes to receive around Christmas time. Disappointed to say I had nothing to offer my dad for Christmas.Update:Recieved an empty bag (package) so the company sent a replacement (thank you) .. Had I known the fit would be way too tight that it cuts my circulation I would have never bothered. Cute keepsake I guess
PupSocks,2021-01-07T23:32:34Z,5,Quality of photo on socks was really good!
PupSocks,2021-01-07T23:28:34Z,3,I ordered a cat blanket and received a dog blanket with my cats face on it. My daughter still liked it but I was disappointed.
PupSocks,2021-01-07T23:24:58Z,1,I’m disappointed that I made a purchase with a 20% discount code and the next day there was an offer for a 30% discount code for which pup socks would not honour.  Purchase was made in mid November and it is still sitting inactive for shipping. Will not be making any future purchases.  Terrible customer service.
PupSocks,2021-01-07T23:24:19Z,5,Best Christmas gift I gave this year. Especially when the recipient shows up at our next gathering with his socks on display!
PupSocks,2021-01-07T23:22:17Z,4,"Pupsocks took a long time to arrive form the US to Aus...but in the nick of time for xmas.Fun product as advertised...the US dollar conversion a bit tough at the moment, so socks are a one off purchase"
PupSocks,2021-01-07T23:22:05Z,1,"It took more than two months to receive my order and when I finally did, the quality was horrific. The socks look like they were made by an amateur and are worthless. Don’t waste your money"
PupSocks,2021-01-07T23:21:43Z,3,The transfer of the images to the socks was perfect. However the socks have a strange feel and have a very strange fit. The foot of the socks are very long and the part that goes up your leg is very tight with no stretch. I bought a men’s sock for a 5’3” 100 lb person with a size 8.5 shoe and the socks are disproportionate in their foot and calf.
PupSocks,2021-01-07T23:20:08Z,5,"They fit like a sock on a foot, very good.  Had the pictures I wanted and looks and feels very nice."
PupSocks,2021-01-07T23:19:33Z,1,Very Very frustrated!!!! I ordered socks a few months ago. They arrived without the photo on them!I emailed the company and after a while they replied that they need another photo.I replied and said it has been way too long and I want my money back.They did not reply!I have now sent 4 emails asking for a refund and they will not reply!
PupSocks,2021-01-07T23:10:06Z,3,The socks were absolutely adorable with my cat’s face on them but what I was disappointed with was the quality of the sock. The material isn’t exactly comfortable and also they are super long.
PupSocks,2021-01-07T23:08:20Z,5,Great product. Wonderful gift for pet owners
PupSocks,2021-01-07T23:08:05Z,2,"The design is super cute, but the fabric is strange."
PupSocks,2021-01-07T23:05:31Z,2,I know it’s due to the times but we still haven’t received our order that was placed end of November
PupSocks,2021-01-07T23:03:58Z,1,I never received my socks... the tracking number given was bogus. I reached out to the company multiple times wit no response... WHAT A SCAM
PupSocks,2021-01-07T23:01:28Z,4,"The photos look awesome on our socks, however one of our pairs (we ordered 3) had the photo mirrored for some reason, so the logo on the hat is backwards. My son didn't want to worry about sending them back for a replacement though, so he'll hopefully still wear them."
PupSocks,2021-01-07T22:59:15Z,1,It’s not even worth a whole star. I placed my order since November 26th and still have yet to receive it. This was expected to be a Christmas gift and I was told I’d receive by then and I did not. I then emailed about it again and was supposed to get a 15% refund that NEVER came through. I’ve completely given up on receiving it but I’d love to get my money back since it’s been nothing but a waste of time AND MONEY! This entire experience has been extremely disappointing and I hope no one else goes through this because honestly it’s a HUGE RIP OFF!! DO NOT PURCHASE FROM HERE go to Etsy or something else because is BS!
PupSocks,2021-01-07T22:53:35Z,1,I placed my order in November and have still not received my product. It was supposed to be a Christmas present.
PupSocks,2021-01-07T22:51:47Z,3,"This is my second time ordering from Pupsocks. The images turn out fabulous. They are a great gift, especially for my sweetheart who has an angel of a dog, so his face lit up when he opened the surprise package. I give it 3 stars because I do not find the material they use remotely quality or comfortable. He has hardly worn the socks because they just don't feel good. I also ordered him a silly face mask, which ended up being more of a gag gift than something he could wear as an effective mask. It is one thin layer and not very protective over nose and mouth. Still, a silly adorable gag gift, but not the kind of functional mask we actually need in these times. Basically, I give the fabrics in everything 1 star at most, and the images of the dog 5, so I averaged it to 3 stars."
PupSocks,2021-01-07T22:51:35Z,2,Not impressed with the quality of sock or the fit. Images seemed ok.   I personally would not recommend to a friend.  Thank you
PupSocks,2021-01-07T22:48:15Z,1,"This is the second time I have ordered from PupSocks. I ordered with the hopes that the second time the socks would be in time for Christmas. I gave a 6 week lead-up and still, 2 weeks after Christmas have not received my order. There has also been no correspondence about the delay In the delivery"
PupSocks,2021-01-07T22:46:32Z,1,"I placed two orders in mid-November, received an emails that I would receive my orders before Christmas, but a few days before Christmas received another email that they were being dropped off at the post office and wouldn't be sent until after Christmas. What a disappointment. These guys didn't even try."
PupSocks,2021-01-07T22:44:07Z,1,It has been since the  middle of November and I still have not seen my order.
PupSocks,2021-01-07T22:43:42Z,1,I had to re order do to a issue with my address and no response from you guys
PupSocks,2021-01-07T22:40:24Z,1,You are a useless company. Mine still haven’t arrived after almost 2 months. Not happy at all
PupSocks,2021-01-07T22:39:24Z,5,"I had an issue where one sock was left off and got an extra of another. I informed you, you replied back, and took care of the missing sock. Great communication, you took care of the issue, and left me with a great impression of your company. Mistakes happen and you did an excellent job of resolving it. Thank you!"
PupSocks,2021-01-07T22:37:34Z,4,Love the image that was printed on the socks.  Only suggestion would be if we had different sock types to choose from.  ankle socks vs tube sock etc.
PupSocks,2021-01-07T22:37:25Z,5,I ordered a blanket with my wife's dog on it for Christmas and she absolutely loved it. The picture I sent was cropped good so it didn't look weird (I was a bit scared it might look bad). My wife absolutely loved it.
PupSocks,2021-01-07T22:35:17Z,3,The masks I ordered were a bit disappointing. The were small and rather flimsy. They don’t cover the nose very well. They are very cute but not very practical.
PupSocks,2021-01-07T22:33:04Z,2,"The product is as expected, but I ordered it for an xmas gift on Nov 26 and it didn't arrive until Jan 6, which was obviously not helpful. Product turned out great though."
PupSocks,2021-01-07T22:31:48Z,3,The service and quality was on point. The texture of the socks is a little unforgivable
PupSocks,2021-01-07T22:25:35Z,5,Love these socks!!!
PupSocks,2021-01-07T22:23:59Z,3,The print was awesome- the pictures of our dog were clear. The socks themselves are very tight and uncomfortable.
PupSocks,2021-01-07T22:23:54Z,4,"I really like the socks.  The picture of my dog looks great, very crisp and clear.   Only negative comment was regarding the time it took to receive the socks.  I ordered near the end of November and i didn't receive until beginning of January which was late for Christmas."
PupSocks,2021-01-07T22:17:58Z,2,"Horrible mask. No give, no shape, just a flat mask no one will wear. Extremely disappointed. Only good thing is the cuteness of our cat on it. Shipping took forever and didn't arrive for Christmas after being ordered in November. Waste of money."
PupSocks,2021-01-07T22:17:46Z,1,Ordered back in November within Christmas delivery guidelines. Still haven’t got with hardly any communication while I’m sympathetic to Covid I ordered within guidelines stated. Hugely disappointing especially as it was a Christmas present. Will not shop here again. And will hit recommend either.
PupSocks,2021-01-07T22:14:30Z,3,"Crop job was a bit off. I would have preferred a proof before having the socks mailed, would've made a simple adjustment. Live and learn. I gave them to my wife and she was happy."
PupSocks,2021-01-07T22:05:29Z,3,"Everything seems to be fine except I haven't received the product yet, hence the 3"
PupSocks,2021-01-07T22:04:18Z,1,"I was really hopeful as the ordering experience was fun and easy. However, I ordered my socks on November 25, and as of January 7 still no socks. I emailed the company around December 17 because I had no updates except the item was in production. Interestingly, the item shipped on December 18 (one day after my complaint). When I ordered, I was promised 10-15 day delivery for international orders - they hadn't even MADE the socks by the 15-day mark. Pupsocks responded to my email about 5 business days after I sent it in - and they addressed it to Gemma (I'm Melissa). I do like that they acknowledged things were shipping slowly with a free printable postcard, but if they had made my socks and shipped them as originally promised, maybe they wouldn't have missed the mark so terribly.I can't hold pupsocks accountable for slow Christmas delivery after they shipped. However, they didn't even ship my order until 24 days after I placed it. And, I still don't have my socks, so I don't even know if I'll ever get them or if they actually shipped them to me."
PupSocks,2021-01-07T22:02:53Z,1,"Ordered in November 2020, it’s January 7,2021 and STILL haven’t received my order. Before I ordered I checked where it’s ships from thinking that I would receive my before Christmas because we are both on the east coast.After numerous attempts to contact PupSocks inquiring on the status of my item I never got any information. The lack of communication is very frustrating and is a very poor way to conduct a business!"
PupSocks,2021-01-07T22:02:51Z,5,The blanket is adorable!!! My daughter loved it!! It features both of our dogs & looks great!!! 😍😍
PupSocks,2021-01-07T21:58:46Z,5,Fast production and delivery.   The picture quality was incredible.
PupSocks,2021-01-07T21:58:46Z,1,Have not received my order as of yet and not much communication
PupSocks,2021-01-07T21:57:58Z,1,No response:I order 2 blankets set $150. It was a Christmas gift for my 2 kids with their own cats on them. Only received one set so my one child didn’t get hers. Right now my kid is sad and I’m out $75. I have email (several times) and tried to get in touch with the company for 3 weeks. No response at all. No number to call. I am very unhappy and sad for my child. I wish I could write something better and would if they respond to me. I would even be happy if they would send me my stuff (still). Unfortunately I am seeing a lot of these review and this is disappointing as I think the idea is great and the company should fixes all these issues
PupSocks,2021-01-07T21:57:44Z,5,My kids loved their sock for Christmas.
PupSocks,2021-01-07T21:57:40Z,1,"I placed my order on November 26, 2020. It said it was supposed to be delivered December 24, 2020. Today is January 7, 2021 and I have still yet to receive my two blankets that I ordered. I have emailed the company two times with no response. I am currently out $146."
PupSocks,2021-01-07T21:56:16Z,1,"Didn’t love the finished product, poor response rate for customer service and still waiting for something that was ordered in mid-November. Not impressed at all and definitely wouldn’t recommend."
PupSocks,2021-01-07T21:52:54Z,1,"Ordered on 26th November, hope i get it before 2022"
PupSocks,2021-01-07T21:52:45Z,1,"They were super cute but after my husband washing them only once, our dog’s face started fading and looking weird.  For a $24 pair of socks, I would’ve thought they’d have looked nice for longer than one wash. I will not order again nor will I recommend to anyone."
PupSocks,2021-01-07T21:51:03Z,1,The socks did not turn up! Just received an empty package.Sad and disappointment.
PupSocks,2021-01-07T21:50:32Z,1,"I wouldn't know how to rate the product since I never received it.  Now, it's the postal services fault, however, I received a label for the package and there was NO package attached to it!!!!!!  I have sent emails to both Pupsocks and USPS and nothing has been done!!!!"
PupSocks,2021-01-07T21:48:13Z,5,I gave  these socks to my brother and he loved them!  I recommend these.   They shipped very quickly but the products were delayed after crossing Canadian border.   Not pupsocks fault but worth noting.   It took a month to receive.
PupSocks,2021-01-07T21:47:46Z,5,I ordered 4 sets of PupSocks for my family for Christmas and everyone loved them!  They thought it was a unique and personalized gift and loved them.
PupSocks,2021-01-07T21:47:29Z,4,"I ordered a pup blanket for a Christmas gift. We love the blanket and how the photo of our dog turned out, as well as the quality of the blanket.  Despite ordering a month before Christmas, the gift did not arrive.  HOWEVER, when I wrote to inquire on the status of the item, I received the best response...an sincere apology along with a photo of the shipping backlog at the USPS.  I appreciated the follow up to my inquiry, and the only thing that could have been better was a shipping status report before I wrote to ask where it was.  I understand that this holiday season was very challenging for retailers.  Thank you for a fun gift."
PupSocks,2021-01-07T21:45:58Z,1,I received the wrong socks. I ordered a pair of socks of my friend’s dog for my friend as a birthday gift and received socks with a cat on them. Unacceptable.
PupSocks,2021-01-07T21:45:00Z,1,"Unfortunately, the product was good but the order wasn’t correct.  There were supposed to be two different faces printed all over the mask but there was only one face.  Further, once I received it, I did not hear back from the company regarding a corrected version."
PupSocks,2021-01-07T21:40:03Z,1,I never received my purchase. I emailed for an update but didn’t get any reply.
PupSocks,2021-01-07T21:36:39Z,4,Socks were nice.
PupSocks,2021-01-07T21:36:16Z,2,I ordered blankets nov 30th for Christmas gifts and it has not arrived yet.
PupSocks,2021-01-07T21:34:34Z,5,We loved the blanket and socks they were so soft and cute and the kids loved them
PupSocks,2021-01-07T21:32:48Z,5,So happy with the socks I ordered with my pups face all over.   Will be ordering more !
PupSocks,2021-01-07T21:31:35Z,1,Awful service. Ordered socks on November 21st and to this date (January 7th) they have still not been delivered and emails unanswered by the company. I don’t even want the product anymore. Just a refund. The holidays are over.
PupSocks,2021-01-07T21:25:45Z,5,"My girlfriend loved her Christmas presents! I will say, always upload high quality photos, but the designer listened to exactly what I wanted and I couldn't be happier! The fit is great and I've already washed them each (3) a lot of times and no complaints here."
PupSocks,2021-01-07T21:24:47Z,5,Arrived before Christmas and they sent a second pair later by accident ^_^Size S fits wider than expected but otherwise happy with the length and quality. There is a cute white on black varsity stripe in the top inner hem for cute folding!
PupSocks,2021-01-07T21:22:07Z,5,Great product that turned out as planned and ordered! Our family loves them.
PupSocks,2021-01-07T21:21:46Z,1,Took to long to receive item. I still have not received it
PupSocks,2021-01-07T21:18:14Z,5,Great job on my blanket! The picture looks great and it is super soft and warm!
PupSocks,2021-01-07T21:18:00Z,1,"I placed my order on November 26th, 2020 when the website advertised “ships next day”. My product wasn’t shipped until December 5th. I still have not received my order (January 7, 2021). I sent an inquiry about my order on Jan. 1 and still have gotten no response. Very disappointed."
PupSocks,2021-01-07T21:15:42Z,1,I never received my order
PupSocks,2021-01-07T21:13:47Z,1,"Never got my socks yet. Ordered on November 26th. Thanks PupSocks, there goes a Christmas present."
PupSocks,2021-01-07T21:12:50Z,5,Cropped pics as requested. Order made a great gift. Came in time for Christmas. Wife loved em.
PupSocks,2021-01-07T21:12:02Z,3,The idea is wonderful and what you can do with a picture is very cool. I don’t know if the quality of the actual sock can be improved. Only time will tell on how well the socks hold up. I thought they would be a thicker quality.
PupSocks,2021-01-07T21:06:46Z,1,Very disappointed.   Ordered socks 1 month ago - no communication if / when delivery will happen. I have tried to communicate a number of times via email and the on line support - no response.  Truly shameful business practice.  Would give 0 rating if possible
PupSocks,2021-01-07T20:53:11Z,5,Pictures we chose were from Instagram they were perfectly cropped and looked amazing
PupSocks,2021-01-07T20:51:31Z,1,"My order was placed 11/26, took 3 weeks in production and didn’t ship until 12/18, and didn’t arrive until a week after Christmas. The cropping on the photo was horrible, and my white/grey cat face has tan on it. Many customers have the same complaints and this seems to be a running theme for this company every holiday season. The quality of materials is dollar store level. For $80 I expected more. I won’t be ordering in the future. 0/10. Would not recommend."
PupSocks,2021-01-07T20:49:54Z,1,Still haven't received order from November 2020.
PupSocks,2021-01-07T20:46:40Z,4,"Would have been 5 star but did not arrive for Christmas. No fault of yours due to high volume, COVID, etc.  Quality was amazing. Pleasantly surprised. Picture was accurate and colours were perfect. The email sent out explaining delay was helpful and I was able to send to the people I was giving this to for Xmas. Mind you, it was kinda fun to see something come in the mail after Xmas. Lol. Would highly recommend pruduct. I ordered the socks in blue with  golden doodle on it. Thanks again for a great product."
PupSocks,2021-01-07T20:26:47Z,4,"Picture of my pup was great, the socks had a different fit. It is not something that will stop me from wearing them or ordering more for that matter. A second pair I purchased was a gift in memory of a pup.  It was probably the most meaningful socks can be."
PupSocks,2021-01-07T20:23:39Z,3,Socks themselves are great. Paid extra for gift packaging which was not included. Appreciated the mockup to give on Christmas.
PupSocks,2021-01-07T20:05:59Z,5,Printing is great.  Great masks!
PupSocks,2021-01-07T20:03:37Z,2,"My son is 12 and I bought a pair of socks for him in a men’s large, just in case they run a little small. They are extremely tight around the calf. He was so excited to get them but so sad that he can’t wear them. He is 5’r” and 115lbs. A mans large should fit easily."
PupSocks,2021-01-07T20:02:29Z,3,"The print was super cool!!! Visually, I love them. But what made me take off a couple of stars is that I wasn't convinced about the material of the sock, very thin and ""glossy"" and the shape of the socks, just too wide."
PupSocks,2021-01-07T20:02:03Z,1,VERY unhappy. Ordered almost $200 worth of socks in November and still waiting for the order to arrive.I will NEVER order again and I will NOT be promoting the product to anyone I know.
PupSocks,2021-01-07T19:53:53Z,4,I thought the sock material had a plastic like texture and would have been happier with a higher quality fabric. Dog pictures were accurate and ordering process was easy.
PupSocks,2021-01-07T19:52:31Z,4,Loved the socks! The material was kind of odd...almost like the socks you used for playing soccer when you were a kid. The dog's face turned out great though and my roommate loved them!
PupSocks,2021-01-07T19:48:35Z,3,The socks are ok.... not as cute as I thought.  I don’t love the material.... pictures are ok
PupSocks,2021-01-07T19:47:21Z,1,Cheap quality
PupSocks,2021-01-07T19:42:39Z,5,The product itself was great that is why the 5 stars is given but shipping was the pits almost 2 months till I received socks the USPS was the reason and Pup Socks should use UPS or FedX for shipping from now on to stop the delay
PupSocks,2021-01-07T19:31:59Z,1,Order was incorrect
PupSocks,2021-01-07T19:29:10Z,5,Excellent job! My wife loved the presents.
PupSocks,2021-01-07T19:25:57Z,1,Very poorly constructed. Extremely overpriced for the quality of the sock.
PupSocks,2021-01-07T19:23:42Z,1,"I was really looking forward to giving my daughter a pair of socks with her cat’s face on them for Christmas. I ordered them in November and received a notification that a shipping label had been created on Dec 9. but the socks never came. On December 24 I got an email saying they were delayed but they were sending me a picture of the mock-up of the socks so I could show my daughter what she was getting. Finally on Jan 4, the package from pup socks arrived. However, the mailing envelope was not sealed properly on the end, and the socks were not inside.. just an empty envelope. My biggest complaint is that when I e-mailed pupsocks to tell them what had happened (because I couldn’t find a customer service phone number on their website), I got an automatic reply email from them saying that they knew the reason I was contacting them was to inquire about when my order would be shipped. No. That’s not the reason for my email. However, there is no other way to get ahold of someone, so I guess I will just have to wait to see if a person actually reads the email I sent. I am having doubts that I will ever see those socks or even hear from pupsocks again. I understand that you may have been overwhelmed with Christmas ordering, but you have to provide customer support for your products. I will never order from you again, based on the fact that I can’t contact you when there is a problem."
PupSocks,2021-01-07T19:20:18Z,1,Ordered Dec 11th and as of Jan 7th haven't received anything.
PupSocks,2021-01-07T19:12:30Z,5,"We were very happy with the socks. We ordered as a gift for our kids, and they love having their furry buddy on fun socks!"
PupSocks,2021-01-07T19:09:15Z,5,Great gift. Super quality.
PupSocks,2021-01-07T19:07:56Z,5,I ordered two pairs of the cat socks for a friend for a holiday gift. I submitted the photos and indicated how I wanted each cropped and could bit be more pleased with how they turned out.  Great quality. Super soft.
PupSocks,2021-01-07T18:39:38Z,5,"The socks are light and thin but still great! The image is great, they were very easy to order."
PupSocks,2021-01-07T18:24:58Z,5,Turned out better than expected. Provided some bad photos and they cropped them making something beautiful!!!
PupSocks,2021-01-07T18:22:36Z,4,Took a little while to get. About 2 plus weeks. Pics on sock are pretty good. Would I buy them again? Probably not. Good one time gift
PupSocks,2021-01-07T18:21:17Z,5,Great service!Emailed wondering where my socks were and got an amazing reply explaining about shipping at the moment. Set my mind at ease and the socks showed up a week later.Thanks!
PupSocks,2021-01-07T18:20:58Z,1,"DON’T purchase from here, save your money. I’ve waited for a package for almost a month. I’ve emailed them 3 times with no response. Extremely horrible customer service. I’m starting to think they are not even a real company. If I could give a 0 review, I would."
PupSocks,2021-01-07T18:19:21Z,1,Unfortunately there was a delay in delivery which I accepted  due to Covid! Then after waiting for one month and three days 33 days I received my delivery and the item that was sent was not mine! They sent me a mock markup of my item which was correct but the item I received was obviously someone else’s. I have sent two emails to customer service and have not had a response in four days! Very unhappy and totally disappointed!
PupSocks,2021-01-07T18:18:41Z,3,"Pictures of pup on the socks was cute but the material is weird and doesn’t feel comfy , and stretches weirdly around the front of ankle.  I’m assuming material has to be like this to be printed on."
PupSocks,2021-01-07T18:14:25Z,1,I received my order and it was correct. At first they ordered a replacement item for it. Then it was put on hold and I received no information after that. I have sent dozens of emails and got the same auto email with no information and still haven’t been contacted about it. Ridiculous.
PupSocks,2021-01-07T18:07:19Z,1,Ordered a Christmas gift in December and still waiting....it’s now January 7th?!??
PupSocks,2021-01-07T17:50:51Z,5,The socks came out perfect!  We had three pug faces done and I was a little concerned how well they would turn out based on the pictures we were able to provide but I was thrilled to receive them and see how wonderful they turned out.
PupSocks,2021-01-07T17:46:51Z,1,Socks do not fit either of my daughters. Very uncomfortable and awkward fitting.  Contacted company 10 days ago and haven’t heard back from them. Terrible $50 sock purchase. But the cats are cute 🥰
PupSocks,2021-01-07T17:34:08Z,1,"This company has terrible customer service (they completely ignore you) and the product is horrible. I got the socks in the mail a week ago - which was 2 weeks late. I'm very disappointed and want a refund.I ordered on December 13th. Your site said that was enough time to get before Christmas and I even paid for expedited shipping, i.e. via 2-Day Air (w/ Christmas Money Back Guarantee!). They arrived December 29th. 15 Days later!These were a present, so was disappointed at their late arrival, however was intending to overlook that until we opened the package. These socks are TERRIBLE! Sure the faces of our cats are cute, but the quality of the actual socks are HORRID! The material is rough as sandpaper, the elastic has no retention and lost shape immediately, the sizing is ridiculous (Small) WAY too big for a woman who they were purchased for, too small for a a man, me. Socks for $41…. that don’t fit and so far from comfortable anyways I wouldn’t use them to clean with? This is terrible. I want my money back.Troy Knott"
PupSocks,2021-01-07T17:32:07Z,2,I got a mask with my friends dog on it. The print came out great but as a mask it is a poor design and is something she cant use. There is no shape to the mask so its hard for her to breathe and doesnt feel safe against COVID.
PupSocks,2021-01-07T17:28:12Z,1,"I saw these socks and thought what a great Christmas gift this would be for my son.  So, I placed my order on December 5th, which should be more than enough time to receive them in time for Christmas (even with COVID-19 and USPS delays).  On December 15th I checked the order status and it still showed “in production”.  On December 17th I checked the status again and the status hadn’t changed so I sent an email and the only response I received was an auto-generated response saying they were busy due to COVID and blaming the USPS for delivery failures.  On December 22nd I still hadn’t received an update so I emailed the company again and received two real responses, the first stating any order placed before December 11th would be expedited and priority shipped to arrive by Christmas.  The second email said my order had shipped and they provided me with a tracking number.  I thought WOW it’s a Christmas miracle.  Well, Christmas came and went and nothing.  The package showed it was waiting to be picked up by the USPS.  On December 29th I sent another email which wasn’t responded to however, on December 30th my package had been picked up and was now in transit.  I suspect the only reason my package was now in transit was because of the email I sent on December 29th.  I sent another email on January 3rd in which I never received a response.  I finally received my order on January 4th and was extremely disappointed with the product. The socks are extremely small and don’t fit.  Additionally the dog’s image is washed out and doesn’t appear as advertised.I am extremely disappointed and will never use this company again.  There are other companies that provide similar merchandise at nearly half the cost.  I will be reaching out to one of their competitors for all future orders."
PupSocks,2021-01-07T17:28:09Z,1,"I had the worst experience with pup socks. Recieved my order just in time for christmas, yet it was the completely wrong order. I emailed customer service asking for the correct order to be shipped or a refund and have recieved absolutely no response, and that was 2 weeks ago. Would never recommend this business."
PupSocks,2021-01-07T17:27:33Z,1,It's been two months. Never receive the item.Sucks..
PupSocks,2021-01-07T17:26:56Z,1,"I received the socks and they included pictures of a cat? We don’t even have a cat. Process is careless and doesn’t allow the customer to review and approve what the socks are going to look like.  Great idea, need some help in QA."
PupSocks,2021-01-07T17:20:15Z,2,These are the worst socks ever.  They don't bend at the ankle snd look bad.  The mask is made of a material that you cannot breath through!   We did receive the order before christmas and the pic is correct but what a waste of money
PupSocks,2021-01-07T17:06:59Z,1,I placed an order the day after thanksgiving and I still have not received it and it’s January 7th. I emailed inquiring about it on December 26th and haven’t received a response as of yet. I’m extremely disappointed. I was really looking forward to watching my daughter open a Christmas gift that had a picture of her dog all over it. At this point in time I would not recommend pupsocks to anyone.
PupSocks,2021-01-07T16:58:34Z,1,I never got my order
PupSocks,2021-01-07T16:50:37Z,1,"I will absolutely NEVER purchase from this company again. First they claim the order will be processed by the next day, which actually took them a week. Then when it’s finally shipped, it’s taken over 6 WEEKS & I still don’t have my ONE pair of socks. The shipping tracking is absolutely terrible, just tells me the country & there’s weeks with NO UPDATE!"
PupSocks,2021-01-07T16:47:18Z,3,"Was very excited to purchase the concept of our beloved dog on a personalized pair of socks. Even though the order was placed in November and guaranteed to arrive before Christmas, it never did. The socks which arrived after the fact in January were very cute but the printing on the socks is a bit washed out, not exactly full colour as the website products show. Overall a pretty good product and a bit of fun :)"
PupSocks,2021-01-07T16:42:27Z,5,"Gave them a photo and how i wanted to crop it, the result was awesome! It was a small stocking stuffer that made my Christmas day, to see my daughter's face was totally priceless!"
PupSocks,2021-01-07T16:34:10Z,3,"While my daughter loves her blanket there are some weird colors on our cat's photo (he has a semi-purple face), that I don't see in the original photo. Since it arrived after Christmas anyway, I would have appreciated an email suggesting that I use a different photo. Or the person making the blanket tweaking the colors a bit to make them more normal."
PupSocks,2021-01-07T16:32:19Z,1,"These socks took forever to arrive and I kept getting emails that if you order (after I had ordered) the socks you will get them before the new year. I got mine after the new year. I don't like it when companies make promises they cant keep. Just don't make them. The socks themselves are crap. The material is synthetic garbage, the print is blurry, customer services is horrible. DON""T BUY THESE SOCKS!"
PupSocks,2021-01-07T16:29:30Z,5,Brilliant!!!
PupSocks,2021-01-07T16:26:05Z,5,The socks came with all 4 images as expected but laid out better than expected. They are thoroughly appreciated.
PupSocks,2021-01-07T16:23:42Z,1,"I placed an order for a Christmas present. I received it the day before Christmas and it was the wrong order. I emailed quickly and only received and automated response that they are busy and will respond as soon as possible. 2 weeks later, I have now emailed a third time a received the same automated response. I am still without my correct order and Christmas present. Maybe I will receive my order in time for next Christmas. This is ver poor customer service and I do not recommend this company."
PupSocks,2021-01-07T16:21:56Z,1,"Placed the order November 26th, Christmas presents. Still haven’t received the socks (January 7th). Have contacted the company by email, but no answer. Would not recommend to order from this company."
PupSocks,2021-01-07T16:21:44Z,2,"The masks are very cute but they are too small and fit poorly.  I'm really disappointed.  I knew from past experience (a few years ago my order arrived after Christmas) that I needed to order early, still the order took longer than expected to arrive and it was difficult to track the progress.  We have ordered many things from PupSocks over the years, I just wish the quality and service were better."
PupSocks,2021-01-07T16:18:44Z,1,"I ordered these socks on the 25th of November. It is now January 6th, and there is still no sign. On the website, the order is listed as ""processing."""
PupSocks,2021-01-07T16:18:01Z,1,I ordered socks for my 10 year old daughter and the socks had no shape to them.   A waste of money.
PupSocks,2021-01-07T16:16:34Z,1,"Terrible experience, will never order from this company again. They mailed the wrong socks (wrong color featuring someone else’s dog) and it took me 6 emails over three weeks to customer support and two different representatives to have the correct pair finally mailed. I one point I asked for a refund and they said they couldn’t give me a full refund. You’ve been warned!"
PupSocks,2021-01-07T16:11:40Z,3,Love the mask however I was only sent one rubber mask guard ...mask is too big to wear and cannot be adjusted.
PupSocks,2021-01-07T16:10:14Z,3,The sock size chart did not provide the best solutions for my order.  The socks are larger than I can wear.
PupSocks,2021-01-07T16:07:15Z,5,My children love the blankets! So soft and they are true to size. We just received them so don’t know yet how they’ll hold up being washed. If I had a complaint it would be how long they took to arrive. But I understand there was a lot of backlog because of the holidays/COVID. It was great that they sent an email when they realized it wasn’t going to make it in time with a pic of the blankets. I I’ll definitely order again.
PupSocks,2021-01-07T16:05:42Z,1,I have not received my order yet!!!!
PupSocks,2021-01-07T15:58:02Z,5,"I give 5 stars because the ordering process was super easy, completed all on my phone. From deciding the color of socks and which two pictures I wanted it took probably less than 10 minutes. After ordering I received steady contact emails to keep informed on the production and when the socks shipped. Outstanding product and  outstanding customer service!!!"
PupSocks,2021-01-07T15:56:50Z,1,Placed my order 6 weeks before Christmas and it still hasn't arrived. (8 weeks on)
PupSocks,2021-01-07T15:54:43Z,1,"I ordered on November 26, 2020 hoping that the purchase would arrive by Christmas.  I received an email December 8, 2020 stating that the order was shipped.  I was still hoping that the purchase would arrive as it was a Christmas gift. It is now January 7, 2021 and I still haven't received the item."
PupSocks,2021-01-07T15:54:04Z,5,"Excellent product, would recommend."
PupSocks,2021-01-07T15:51:34Z,1,I ordered my blanket in November for a Christmas present. I didn’t receive the blanket till January. I was not happy. Spending that much money on a small thin fuzzy blanket and it took so long to get:
PupSocks,2021-01-07T15:51:17Z,5,"Got my boyfriend some socks with our dogs face in space, they’re absolutely perfect. Highly recommend!"
PupSocks,2021-01-07T15:48:11Z,1,"Pretty horrible socks. You guys messed up two different orders, and then we actually got the socks, they aren't even shaped like feet!"
PupSocks,2021-01-07T15:45:07Z,1,"Placed my order on November 26, 2020 (was supposed to be a Christmas gift).....it’s January 7, 2021 and my order still isn’t here.Not sure why fast shipping is advertised when it clearly doesn’t happen."
PupSocks,2021-01-07T15:40:16Z,5,"My wife lost her beloved Boston Terrier, Jasmine, this summer. When she opened the package on Christmas morning and found socks with Jazzy's picture on them, she was choked up and incredibly pleased. She said it may have been the best Christmas gift I've given her in our 31 years together. Thanks for making it possible for me to do that."
PupSocks,2021-01-07T15:38:01Z,3,"Let me start by saying the item I ordered was beautiful and of good quality. My son is really enjoying his blanket. What suffered was that this was a Christmas gift ordered on November 26th and was received at my home on January 6th. I contacted the company on December 16th to check on the status and did not receive an email back until January 3rd. In that email it stated the delay was due to shipping, but according to the tracking information, the item was not turned over to the USPS until December 29th. That whole time, the item was marked as “in production “ on your website. Do not advertise 3 day production if it takes over a month. I am aware of Covid issues, but this was excessive."
PupSocks,2021-01-07T15:34:42Z,5,Awesome product.  My daughter’s favorite blanket now
PupSocks,2021-01-07T15:31:19Z,1,Took over a month to receive them. Material quality reminds me of hospital compression socks
PupSocks,2021-01-07T15:29:32Z,1,Ordering from this company was a mistake. I NEVER received my order. UPS tracking say it was returned to sender. I haven't received a single communication from the seller except asking me provide this review. Customer service is non-responsive. I want my money back but no one is responding. Never ordering from here again!
PupSocks,2021-01-07T15:18:08Z,4,"Good quality socks, looks very pretty. Only problem was I was told it would arrive before Christmas, (I ordered the on December 8th) and they arrived January 3rd. So bummer I couldn't give the as a gift, but the socks are good."
PupSocks,2021-01-07T15:07:20Z,1,"Socks were of poor quality and the cut of the sock was not shaped to fit a foot. Also, one of the images was not cropped correctly and no proof was provided before the socks were printed. The socks were priced too high considering the poor quality and workmanship. Shipping was also very delayed and arrived weeks after original ETA. Also, emails keep being sent even though I unsubscribed. Very unsatisfied. Do not recommend."
PupSocks,2021-01-07T15:00:23Z,4,The socks/blankets are really nice!  My wife really liked them.The only problem was how long it took to receive them.  I know USPS was backed up but it took almost a month.  Has the company looked at using a different delivery carrier (UPS and/or FedEx)?I would order from you again.
PupSocks,2021-01-07T14:48:51Z,1,Item arrived fast and looked great.   Upon putting the socks on for the first time the heel ripped a whole.  Reached out to customer service and no response yet.
PupSocks,2021-01-07T14:42:40Z,5,These were a huge hit as Christmas presents.  Great way to highlight the love someone has for their pup!   Thanks!
PupSocks,2021-01-07T13:58:06Z,5,"I ordered a blanket for my daughter with our dog's face on it, and she is in love! The blanket is super soft and comfy, high quality, and most importantly, has our best friend's face all over it. What a great gift for our whole family!"
PupSocks,2021-01-07T13:48:35Z,5,We love our PupSocks!!  They are a cool way to keep our pup with us at all times!  Great gift idea!
PupSocks,2021-01-07T13:38:59Z,4,"I loved the idea of these socks as a cute gift for my husband who loves his dog. The quality of the image on the socks were great and turned out adorable. My only complaint is the material of the sock was not what I expected. It was not a soft cotton, but a thinner, shinier material. Having said that, overall it was a fun gift!"
PupSocks,2021-01-07T13:38:41Z,5,We absolutely love the blanket we purchased! Great quality! Fast delivery! Thank you!
PupSocks,2021-01-07T13:35:28Z,4,They shipped my order late.
PupSocks,2021-01-07T13:35:24Z,1,"Very unhappy that it took more than six weeks to receive them AND they did not arrive in time for my moms birthday. The order had to be replaced, because I initially received someone else’s order! It took about 5 days to reach someone in customer service.  There is NO customer service number listed, so you have to communicate via email. Very frustrating. Would not recommend or reorder from this company."
PupSocks,2021-01-07T13:13:23Z,1,"Hi, there a big mistake in my order. I receive adult size when I order child size. And I receive sock with children face that I do not know instead of my cat. Finally, a receive the bad order more than 6 weeks after I ordered. It will be after Christmas."
PupSocks,2021-01-07T12:48:54Z,1,Lousy service. Ridiculously overpriced.
PupSocks,2021-01-07T12:33:52Z,1,"I ordered on 11/25 for a Christmas present and had it  shipped directly to the recipient.  I ordered a purple blanket and uploaded a picture of my friends dog.  She received the package on 12/22 it was blue and someone else’s dog.  I have emailed several times. Posted  and messaged on social media, it’s now 1/7 and I only get an auto response email from the CEO claiming they no they are behind on shipping it’s USPS fault and they are getting flooded with emails and working hard to get packages shipped before Christmas.  At least change the auto response Christmas is over!!! We are past that point.  I’ve read 100’s of reviews and post that so many people got the wrong shipment or never received.  This is so sad!  Great concept but poorly managed.  I will continue to email until I get a response!  I may even take a trip from Fl to Atlanta GA because I am the person that won’t let not only my 65 dollars but it’s principal! Make it right!!"
PupSocks,2021-01-07T12:32:10Z,1,I ordered a blanket with 2 dogs and only got one dog on the blanket - but i paid for two dogs - very upset - the blanket was nice and soft but it was NOT what was ordered
PupSocks,2021-01-07T12:28:14Z,3,"Visually they turned out great but these are tube socks with a heal printed on them, not a fitted sock.  Not comfy, look great!"
PupSocks,2021-01-07T12:21:50Z,5,The socks I ordered were well-made and arrived on time. I could not be more happy with the final product. The pictures look awesome on the socks.
PupSocks,2021-01-07T11:04:11Z,4,"I was conflicted what to rate this company, but decided to give them 4 stars. I, like many other people ordered well before Christmas and had an extreme delay in receiving my order. I ordered a blanket for my wife for Christmas on December 1st. It did not arrive until January 4th. They did send an email 2 weeks before Christmas stating they were swamped and offered to cancel my order, or continue and receive a discount on future orders. Since It really didn't matter to us if we got it before Christmas, I chose to wait. When the blanket did arrive it was done very nicely. The blanket was very soft and I was impressed by the quality."
PupSocks,2021-01-07T10:07:04Z,1,I was excited to purchase these. I had seen so much advertising about these socks. The ordering process was legit and straight forward. The length of delivery was not acceptable. I have received so much spam advertising of these socks continuing to build up the hype. I received my package today after 6 weeks and the quality is a novelty gag gift.Not worth my hard earn money. Time waiting and the quality of sock is shapeless and garbage. The size is not accurate at all. The idea is a great concept but the quality is trash. The photos came out true based on my submission. I can not get over the shapelessness of they socks. They are not even socks. They are a tube made to look like they have shape. It’s a huge disappointment.
PupSocks,2021-01-07T08:55:57Z,5,"The socks came out great. My wife and I love them. My adult daughter thought I was cheesy for getting them, but I bet she will be getting a pair or two soon."
PupSocks,2021-01-07T08:54:09Z,5,"These socks were spot on! I ordered ones with the faces of my son and his cat as a Christmas present and he was so stoked to receive them! For once he was happy for socks for Christmas!! Excellent quality, really quick processing and shipping, now he’s asking for a blanket for his birthday!"
PupSocks,2021-01-07T08:37:15Z,3,Pretty slow to get it but it was Christmas and covid season lol kinda expected
PupSocks,2021-01-07T07:13:39Z,5,They are great. Great Quality and worth the wait. Very well received gift !
PupSocks,2021-01-07T07:11:38Z,1,"I’m sorry, I understand processing time and delays in shopping due to covid but it has been over a month and I still have not received my order."
PupSocks,2021-01-07T06:51:40Z,1,These took more than a month to arrive and the quality when they finally did arrive was laughable. They reminded me more of a rubber glove than a sock. Definitely not worth the money!
PupSocks,2021-01-07T06:10:30Z,1,"Order the socks 7 weeks ago, haven’t received yet... customer service email not responding."
PupSocks,2021-01-07T05:59:57Z,4,Fun socks.  A bit of a funky fit in the toes.Blanket was great!
PupSocks,2021-01-07T05:26:46Z,1,The socks never turned up.
PupSocks,2021-01-07T05:13:36Z,1,"I made my purchase on November 23, but have never received the product, it is now Jan 07."
PupSocks,2021-01-07T05:01:53Z,2,"I got 4 pairs of socks for my husband and kids and I really wanted to love them because they have our sweet dogs' faces on them and it's such a creative, personal item. However, they were not what I expected. First, they're made of a bizarre material - almost a material a jersey would be made of. They're somewhat silky and the art looks like it's sublimated on them, which makes sense as to why the material is the way it is. The colors also aren't great. I chose the colors based on a computer screen, but it's hard to tell what color will look like in real life. They're bright and not aesthetically appealing or hip whatsoever. Lastly, the fit is very weird. They're boxy, which is weird to say for socks, but it's true. They don't conform well to feet. It turns out, the only cool part about these socks is that they have our dogs on them, but what good is that if they're never used? Unfortunately, these will likely end up in the Goodwill pile. None of my family will ever wear them because of how they fit and feel. I would not order them again and would advise others not to order them unless you're looking for a gag gift."
PupSocks,2021-01-07T04:52:20Z,1,"Ordered one pair of socks on November 24, 2020. Today is January 6, 2021 and I have not received them yet."
PupSocks,2021-01-07T04:42:28Z,1,"The most terrible pair of socks. The print wasn’t horrendous but the fabric and fit - they weren’t really socks as they had no shape, just a tube with weird ribbing and a heel printed on. They don’t fit and I’d never wear them. Don’t think I have the heart to tell the person who bought them for me as a thoughtful gift but I would not recommend at all. A complete waste of money and effort."
PupSocks,2021-01-07T04:37:29Z,1,I did not receive my order
PupSocks,2021-01-07T04:12:17Z,1,I still have not received my order which was placed in November. It was supposed to be a Christmas present so I’m now hoping to get it before March so it can be a Birthday present.Very slow service 😢
PupSocks,2021-01-07T04:12:14Z,1,"1 of 4 pairs of socks was made incorrect; with some random dog on the socks instead of our own and per the order. Even worse, it has been over a week since I requested this be fixed and I have yet to hear any response. Very disappointing, would not recommend at all."
PupSocks,2021-01-07T03:55:18Z,5,These turned out amazing! A great likeness of the dogs. Gave as a gift and she loved them.
PupSocks,2021-01-07T03:35:21Z,2,"The socks are cute but are really not wearable. They are not really foot shaped, and have a weird feel to them. My husband and I are very disappointed with the quality, considering how expensive the socks are."
PupSocks,2021-01-07T03:32:14Z,5,Blanket was amazing! Scored huge with that gift. Socks were unique.
PupSocks,2021-01-07T03:29:55Z,1,still haven't received my socks that was said to be shipped out 12/13/2020 when on the website when I purchased said that was plenty of time before Christmas! And noone has reached out. I understand that it was only $29.99 pair of socks but it was 1 of only 2 gifts I got for my wife.
PupSocks,2021-01-07T03:26:23Z,3,"The print is adorable but my daughter won't wear the socks because they are a rough materials. To be honest, I wouldn't wear them either.  Adorable idea but falls short."
PupSocks,2021-01-07T03:04:56Z,3,The photo turned out super cute but the socks were not the best quality.  They won't wear or wash well.
PupSocks,2021-01-07T03:04:39Z,1,I ordered pup socks n December 4th. The package finally arrived with NOTHING in it. I emailed the company on Dec 23 and received and automatic reply stating that they were backlogged. It has been two weeks since I reached out and I have heard nothing.
PupSocks,2021-01-07T03:00:04Z,1,"No customer service. ...at all. Literally. I placed an order on December 15th and still haven't received my items (January 6th), nor have I heard one word back from customer service, who I also reached out to on the 15th of December, when I placed the order. I've reached out 2 or 3 more times since, but have yet to receive anything other than a disingenuous automated message.From what I gather, the CEO, Zach Zelner, had known for a while that thousands and thousands of orders coming in would not be fulfilled in time for the holiday season ...or any time close to the holiday season. But, Zach wanted to maximize profits, so he did. Now he's on vacation in Europe.  Oh, but what about all those thousands and thousands of unfilled orders?? Well, Zach left behind a ""dedicated team"" to make things right, because ""customer service excellence is paramount to the PupSocks team"". ...so, maybe I'll hear from them ...someday. Fingers crossed to receive my order within the first half of 2021. True Story."
PupSocks,2021-01-07T02:58:46Z,1,"I paid for Christmas delivery and then the items came Dec 28.  Not too big a deal, but I paid for “guaranteed” Christmas delivery...then the mock ups of the order they sent to “show the recipient” were not correct.  When the package finally came it was torn open and a mess.  The items were not correct either!  I’ve sent 3 messages with zero response."
PupSocks,2021-01-07T02:51:22Z,1,I put my order in November 25/2020 and didn't receive the item until January 4/2021. It was a Xmas present for my daughter. Way too late.
PupSocks,2021-01-07T02:50:40Z,1,The product sent was not what matched the mock up sent to me via email. It also took a month to get delivered from the time I ordered the gift to when it arrived to it’s destination
PupSocks,2021-01-07T02:48:05Z,2,"I’m sure they’re really nice, but I haven’t received my package yet... and it’s a Christmas gift."
PupSocks,2021-01-07T02:42:00Z,2,"The photo editing and customization part was good, but quality of sock is the reason for the low rating. I had very low expectations to begin with since it is more of a novelty item anyways, but the sock quality was significantly poorer than I expected. The material feels papery, thin, no elasticity, and doesn't have a finished seam at the top. Shipping cost was very reasonable to Canada, but overall cost (along with the exchange rate) made this item not worth the price for me as a Canadian and for its quality."
PupSocks,2021-01-07T02:39:25Z,3,The picture not he actual sock looks great. We ordered the children socks. They are not really smaller. And are definitely too wide for my kids to wear. But they love them. Just cannot wear them...
PupSocks,2021-01-07T02:21:47Z,1,Have not received my order and have tried to contact multiple times about it’s whereabouts.
PupSocks,2021-01-07T02:07:53Z,4,"The product quality was incredible! I ordered masks. They Might be the best quality I have ordered from anyplace and they did a great job ripping the pics.They advertised 7-10 days for delivery and it took 4 weeks before even shipping, but I do realize this was an unprecedented year for shipments."
PupSocks,2021-01-07T02:07:13Z,5,Very comfy blanket
PupSocks,2021-01-07T02:04:34Z,1,"I still haven’t received them. No updates, no refund and communication has now stopped. Seems like a scam."
PupSocks,2021-01-07T01:50:43Z,1,Very disappointed with the result (fabric is cheap and shape is uncomfortable).
PupSocks,2021-01-07T01:46:31Z,1,I did not receive my order!No response from customer service. This company is a scam.
PupSocks,2021-01-07T01:44:00Z,4,"The service was outstanding and the cause is a great one. It was easy to order online and my shipment was received on time. All really good stuff! The socks are a great idea and so so cute and a wonderful gift idea. They were really well received! However,  the quality of the socks was a really big disappointment. They aren’t good socks at all in terms of mix of what there made of. Sadly. They’re some odd type of yarn. This was a real disappointment considering how expensive they are. I expected a better quality material. I hate to be negative in light of so many pluses. Thanks for a cool idea anyways."
PupSocks,2021-01-07T01:31:23Z,2,"The picture of my cat came out nice,  but unfortunately the sock doesn't have the shape of a sock, it feels harsh and looks like a tube.  Very disappointed  😞 work on your sock design!"
PupSocks,2021-01-07T01:08:20Z,1,"My delivery was supposed to be here before Christmas. It is now January 6th and my two gifts are still not here. If I’m being honest, I’m now concerned they may not ever arrive. I’m extremely disappointed. Should I expect delivery soon or should I tell my loved ones they’re gifts are not coming anytime soon. Please let me know so I can update my family on they’re Christmas gifts they expected long ago. Thank you."
PupSocks,2021-01-07T01:08:16Z,1,Got one pair but missing 2 more.  Ordered in early November and it is January 6.
PupSocks,2021-01-07T01:05:28Z,5,Adorable gift!
PupSocks,2021-01-07T00:58:09Z,1,I received the wrong order. Whilst I understand mistakes can be made especially at a busy time of year what annoys me is the fact I have sent multiple FB messages and emails to try and rectify yet have not received a response. Disgraceful customer service.
PupSocks,2021-01-07T00:57:18Z,1,Sorry to say but you printed the wrong dog on our blanket and did not correct it until after the holidays. Not a great Christmas gift.
PupSocks,2021-01-07T00:52:41Z,2,Very expensive for 2 pairs of socks and shipping was not included. And then it took almost 3 weeks to ship.
PupSocks,2021-01-07T00:37:59Z,5,Socks were awesome and they arrived quickly.
PupSocks,2021-01-07T00:37:25Z,2,Socks were of poor quality.  Picture was not clear.
PupSocks,2021-01-07T00:31:05Z,4,"The cut out of our dog was wonderful, you did a great job.  The only think about it was that the socks look a little weird,  the style I guess. Other than that,  my daughter teared up when she seen them.  Thanks PupSocks!"
PupSocks,2021-01-07T00:27:35Z,1,Ordered 6 weeks ago still not received the order
PupSocks,2021-01-07T00:15:31Z,5,The socks were awesome and as described. They did take a while to get to New Zealand but understandable considering that it was pre Christmas and all overseas mail seemed to take ages to get here.
PupSocks,2021-01-07T00:12:13Z,1,"Quality of socks is not great. Cute idea, but too expensive for oddly shaped socks."
PupSocks,2021-01-07T00:04:04Z,4,Love the socks but I ordered them for a Christmas gift and they arrived after Christmas and i didn’t get reliable updates to track my order.
PupSocks,2021-01-07T00:03:31Z,1,I never received the product and no one ever got back to my email!
PupSocks,2021-01-07T00:00:36Z,4,"Love the socks, but delivery took exceptionally long."
PupSocks,2021-01-07T00:00:01Z,2,The material was not high quality.
PupSocks,2021-01-06T23:51:17Z,1,Still haven’t received the PupSocks I ordered at the end of November.
PupSocks,2021-01-06T23:47:58Z,1,It’s hard to provide a review of a product that was never received when ordered almost 8 weeks ago. I emailed the company and still have not received an ETA on delivery.
PupSocks,2021-01-06T23:41:09Z,1,Extremely disappointed with shipping process
PupSocks,2021-01-06T23:39:57Z,5,The socks I purchased were a gift for my children. When they received them they absolutely loved them! The vibrant colours of bright blue and bright green are gorgeous and the pictures of my puppies looked wonderful! The socks themselves are of a very good quality weave. They bring a smile to my children’s face every time they wear them. :D
PupSocks,2021-01-06T23:24:40Z,1,This is the second email I have received requesting me to fill out the feedback form. I have still not received my order despite placing the order months ago. I have previously sent an email about this but have not yet been told where my order is and why I have not received it yet.
PupSocks,2021-01-06T23:18:03Z,2,I ordered the kids size for my 4.5 year old toddler and they are way too big.  The images look great (2 cat faces) but material is a bit strange.  These are not typical sock material.  I would not recommend the socks.
PupSocks,2021-01-06T23:17:45Z,1,Ordered the socks over a month ago and have yet to receive the items so I can not review the products
PupSocks,2021-01-06T23:11:32Z,1,"Very disappointing customer service and supply chain. Ordered a pair of socks  2 months ago as a Christmas present for my partner. It is now mid-January and the item still hasn't arrived. I've ordered products from further away, and closer to Christmas that came well before."
PupSocks,2021-01-06T23:10:26Z,1,These socks did not turn out anything like I expected. The sizing is super awkward. The foot part is like a big rectangle with zero elasticity. I got them for my daughter and they are unwearable.
PupSocks,2021-01-06T23:06:47Z,1,"You are asking me for a review when I still haven't received my order. I ordered it with plenty of time before Christmas but dont get it. What I got was a digital Christmas card with a pic of my order so I could give that to my girlfriend on Christmas and say "" this is a pic of what I got you"". I'm sure I will love the socks I order for my girlfriend when I get them but right now I'm not loving this."
PupSocks,2021-01-06T23:04:00Z,4,"These are super fun. Just a couple caveats for those of you shopping: 1) The fabric is not super cozy, and the cut is not super fitted. They sort of fit like having a bag on your feet. 2) I found the sizes a little tough to get right, running a bit large in reality. Overall, a fun novelty gift, but don't expect luxury. :)"
PupSocks,2021-01-06T23:00:08Z,1,The socks were such poor quality material and had an odd fit. Super unhappy.
PupSocks,2021-01-06T22:58:05Z,1,"Socks are way too large, using the size chart...and the feet have zero shape to them...sent two messages over two weeks and got no actual response. After spending 28 bucks on a pair of socks for my wife, you'd think the issue would have been remedied. Instead, nothing but a computer generated response."
PupSocks,2021-01-06T22:57:31Z,2,Picture on socks looked nice but the fabric felt a  little cheap which was a bit disappointing given the price.
PupSocks,2021-01-06T22:49:42Z,1,"Sock quality is terrible.  Unwearable, uncomfortable, poor design.  Do not purchase.  You will be disappointed."
PupSocks,2021-01-06T22:47:27Z,1,I am disappointed in this company. I know some of this is beyond the company’s control BUT my order from November 25th has not arrived yet & it’s Jan 6th. My order was for Christmas presents & I was SO disappointed not to have my socks!!!
PupSocks,2021-01-06T22:40:55Z,1,They sent me the wrong socks.Took over a week for them to correct the order.
PupSocks,2021-01-06T22:39:59Z,1,I HAVENT GOTTEN MY SOCKS YET! it’s been 6 weeks.
PupSocks,2021-01-06T22:32:33Z,1,Ordered in November and my product never came. They said they are printing another but no notification of that either. Would not recommend as I don’t believe I am ever going to get what I ordered. Very very disappointed.
PupSocks,2021-01-06T22:27:33Z,1,I never received my order
PupSocks,2021-01-06T22:25:41Z,5,Socks came out great and son loved them
PupSocks,2021-01-06T22:09:17Z,1,"Placed my order on 11/25 and still haven’t received it. Attempted to track it, and it has noInformation after 12/27. I understand there are some delays, but I ordered many things online from all over the world, and received everything except my Pup Socks. Terrible!"
PupSocks,2021-01-06T22:05:20Z,5,"Great product, gave as a gift and it came out perfect!"
PupSocks,2021-01-06T22:03:21Z,5,"Loved the blanket, very nice quality & the puppy loves looking at her own face!!"
PupSocks,2021-01-06T21:58:43Z,1,We got some one else’s socks
PupSocks,2021-01-06T21:54:02Z,2,"Granted the pandemic slowed down shipping times, but I ordered this from a New Zealand URL thinking it was a local company. Turns out they were manufactured outside is NZ, shipped from New York, and then sent through Japan.The second issue is that the socks were is the absolute lowest quality. The blanket was good but the socks were astonishingly thin and not at all what I expected. One pair has already been ruined by a pulled thread. Overall, not at all happy."
PupSocks,2021-01-06T21:42:27Z,5,Gud sox. Me like sox. Sox have doggo on sox
PupSocks,2021-01-06T21:32:24Z,2,"The blanket was nice soft fabric, however, one of the four dog faces was almost blacked out when the image transferred on to the blanket. You can’t even tell it is a dog. I would expect the work would be inspected for a $90 blanket."
PupSocks,2021-01-06T21:21:02Z,1,"I was sent socks with the wrong dog on them. I reached out to customer service and was told due to increased demand, it would be weeks before I could speak with anyone. Still waiting on the option for a refund... not holding my breath."
PupSocks,2021-01-06T21:15:48Z,1,"Took over a month from order until received. When received item was completely wrong. I ordered socks with my 2 cat faces on, I received socks with someone’s dog photo on it!!!"
PupSocks,2021-01-06T21:05:16Z,3,The sizing and material was not what l expected probably would not have ordered if l had seen them first hand.
PupSocks,2021-01-06T20:58:27Z,5,My wife loved the socks. They were even able to fulfill my special request to include my cat's bow tie collar in the photo!
PupSocks,2021-01-06T20:57:23Z,1,I still don’t have my order ???Not happy at all I want a refund . It’s been way too long .
PupSocks,2021-01-06T20:54:26Z,5,"Really great gift! I got the sock + blanket combo. To be honest, the socks were a bit less than I expected. They have the feel/texture of a polyester tie, where I expected it to be fluffier. Still, the blankets totally redeemed it. Nice, fluffy and comfortable. The cat pictures I provided (that I was worried were low res) came out looking great. And my friend absolutely loved it. Was also super happy with customer service. When the socks were missing from the first order, they made sure to send it out right away. I probably won’t get the socks in the future. But the blanket is an excellent gift that I’ll be sure to get again for someone else and would definitely recommend."
PupSocks,2021-01-06T20:51:11Z,2,Very cheap and uncomfortable but the idea is funny for sure ..
PupSocks,2021-01-06T20:45:20Z,3,"Love the sock, hate the fit.  Ordered normal size and they are way too big.Alot of money to spend on something that can't be worn."
PupSocks,2021-01-06T20:29:34Z,1,I ordered socks on 25 November as a xmas gift and I still haven't received them.
PupSocks,2021-01-06T20:27:41Z,1,"I’d give no stars if I could right now. I ordered socks Nov 24th. It “Arrived” Jan 5th. I was home & saw them deliver it but waited to go to the door a few minutes for covid reasons. Only to find the UPS bag was delivered, no product inside. After being perfectly sliced open it was delivered. Why bother? Whether it’s lost or stolen they now have my puppies face on a pair of socks and my dog sitter still has yet to receive her what I thought was a thoughtful gift. Very disappointed. Hoping to hear back as to what will be done to correct the problem."
PupSocks,2021-01-06T20:18:35Z,1,Took over 1 month to receive when I reached out to customer service they told me it would be by me before Christmas and it came 1 week after.
PupSocks,2021-01-06T20:12:42Z,5,so very cute!!!!!!!!!
PupSocks,2021-01-06T20:11:33Z,5,Love how these turned out!
PupSocks,2021-01-06T20:07:37Z,3,"The quality of the printing was fine, but the socks themselves didn't look very comfortable. Gave as a gift and it was well received, but would probably look for a different company if I wanted to give a similar gift in the future."
PupSocks,2021-01-06T20:00:50Z,5,"I purchased these for my Christmas “silly socks” tradition with my girls. They were a huge it! Not only were they cute, they were extremely soft! My girls loved them so much that we’ve already ordered next year’s socks! They are all extremely cute but the llamas are my favorite!"
PupSocks,2021-01-06T20:00:04Z,5,"Beautiful quality blanket that the recipient voted best gift of Christmas 2020! Took some extra time to make it here, but it was worth the wait!"
PupSocks,2021-01-06T19:59:33Z,1,"It's January 6 and the Christmas present for my daughter is still not here, even though I ordered it in November. Sorry, won't order again and should get a refund"
PupSocks,2021-01-06T19:57:33Z,5,love them!!!
PupSocks,2021-01-06T19:56:45Z,5,"I purchased a pair of socks for my girlfriend for Christmas. They have her cats' faces on them. They look fantastic! Ordered them in late November and they just arrived, which is completely understandable due to COVID-19 and international shipping. Would definitely order again!"
PupSocks,2021-01-06T19:54:16Z,1,"ordered Nov 25 as an xmas gift and they arrived Jan 5th, not good service!"
PupSocks,2021-01-06T19:54:05Z,1,"As much as I would love to give a great review, I can’t as I have never received the product that I ordered back in November 2020.  I contacted both shipping company and pup socks regarding the delay and it took them over a week to get back to me.  I understand that it was an incredibly busy time and so gave ample time for them to respond.  Eventually I received an email from pup socks saying my shipment was lost and would I like a replacement. I immediately replied that yes I would like a replacement as it was a gift and now once again I am still waiting, almost 2 weeks now, to get any response that they received my request and are working on it.Is the product good? I have no idea but the customer service has disappointed me."
PupSocks,2021-01-06T19:53:30Z,2,"The picture that was submitted looked great on the socks, however, I ordered a XS for my daughter and they are huge (she wears a size 6-7 woman's shoe). Not only are the socks way too big for her to wear, they are so wide they don't even really look like a sock. $26 later and she can't even wear them."
PupSocks,2021-01-06T19:51:17Z,1,"Ordered socks with our dogs picture. It did look like our dog; however he is a black lab and he looked like a chocolate lab on the pink socks and light blue socks. The socks themselves are poor quality, odd feel to them, very tight like a compression sock. Would not recommend spending this kind of money for basically useless  product !!!!"
PupSocks,2021-01-06T19:50:14Z,1,"Awful service - avoid at all costs.  I ordered from Pup socks before Thanksgiving and reached out to see where the order was in regards to procurement.  When I received the order, 4 days before Christmas, it was someone else's blanket with a different dog.  I was extremely disappointed as this was a gift to my significant other.  The worst part is when I tried contacting the company, I never received a response besides an automated response from the ""CEO"" apologizing for any delay.  It's been three weeks and I still haven't heard a peep.  This company does not have their things together and I would NEVER recommend."
PupSocks,2021-01-06T19:47:43Z,1,No clear state of the order. No tracking untill a month after the order was made. The staff replied only the second time I asked them something. It has almost been 2 months and nothing has arrived. Not recommended. Never again.
PupSocks,2021-01-06T19:44:53Z,1,"I ordered a pair of cat socks for a Christmas gift, and got the completely wrong socks in the mail with pictures of someone else's dog on them. Had to message customer support a dozen times through the website (email didn't work) and nearly a month later I finally get the right socks. They are pretty useless at this point since Christmas was almost two weeks ago, and it is infuriating that no one from customer support sent any message acknowledging the mix up. Also, the socks are made with crappy cheap material and I still wouldn't recommend them even without all the other issues."
PupSocks,2021-01-06T19:44:49Z,4,"Socks came out great, quality of the socks is not the best but after a few washes they are still in good shape"
PupSocks,2021-01-06T19:42:19Z,1,havent received anything.
PupSocks,2021-01-06T19:37:44Z,1,"I received the Wrong Blanket Order , I am still waiting for PupSocks to respond to correct  this.   No response makes it even more frustrating besides receiving the wrong Blanket Order.If PupSocks had a real customer service that responded to issue would be helpful or maybe a telephone number you could call to resolve issues."
PupSocks,2021-01-06T19:36:38Z,4,"The printing was great.  My husband loved the concept.  But, the socks are not designed with a proper heel wedge so he said they were uncomfortable to wear all day due the bunching up in the front of the ankle."
PupSocks,2021-01-06T19:35:48Z,4,not the best socks but for the price funny..arrived late
PupSocks,2021-01-06T19:34:18Z,2,"Mixed experienceI loved the idea and I actually love the way my pet was printed on the socks, but the socks themselves are kind of unwearable. The fabric is not great (but I assume it's harder to print on a softer, more cotton-like fabric) and the color choices are not great. So it was a great gag gift sort of thing, but the socks are not really wearable."
PupSocks,2021-01-06T19:30:12Z,5,What an easy and rewarding experience! I just uploaded a picture of my dog and that was it!  My daughter loved her socks.
PupSocks,2021-01-06T19:29:10Z,5,"So. So. So. SO GREAT.We adopted our retired greyhound two years ago and to say she’s the best thing we ever did would be a total understatement. We’re all completely smitten with her. I ordered socks for everyone (myself, my husband, our son) for Christmas this year. Unfortunately, due to issues outside of the company’s control, they didn’t make it on time. However, receiving the order mock-up allowed me to print them and tease our adorable stocking stuffers to everyone. The quality is great, though I wish they were a little tighter. HIGHLY recommend for a fun and customized gift."
PupSocks,2021-01-06T19:26:00Z,5,I ordered 2 pairs of socks for my kids for Christmas. They were like ' yay socks...' then quickly followed by 'OMG it's Max!!' They really thought it was awesome!
PupSocks,2021-01-06T19:22:57Z,5,These socks are simply adorable.  My husband loved his pair with our new puppies face on them.
PupSocks,2021-01-06T19:22:32Z,1,"I still haven't even received them. They've stopped contacting me. Handed me over to the shipping company who just said ""keep waiting""..."
PupSocks,2021-01-06T19:22:18Z,1,Ordered my socks a month out from Christmas and as of the 7th January they still haven’t come. Very disappointed
PupSocks,2021-01-06T19:16:13Z,2,3 of my 4 socks were done correctly. They printed the wrong picture on one pair. I have yet to hear from them for follow up about this. Need better and more accessible customer service help.
PupSocks,2021-01-06T19:14:53Z,1,"Placed an order November 25 2020 and received confirmation of shipment and a tracking number  on December 7th. To date (January 6th 2021) my order still reads “shipping information received”. I have contacted Pup Socks on December 21st and again today (January 6th 2021) regarding my order, only to receive the same automatically generated response about Covid-19 and the holidays. The company advertised that the products would be delivered before Christmas and they were not. I was hoping that my customer service inquiry made almost three weeks ago would have been answered by now. I’ve received a lot of advertising though! Hoping someone will reach out to me soon..."
PupSocks,2021-01-06T19:13:35Z,5,These were a Christmas gift. The recipient was absolutely delighted to have her favorite pups immortalized on socks!
PupSocks,2021-01-06T19:11:15Z,5,A very cute gift for any “puppy loving” person. The process of choosing a design was easy and the final product was well done.
PupSocks,2021-01-06T19:07:01Z,1,Still have not received. This was Xmas gifts.  Ordered in plenty of time.   Very disappointed
PupSocks,2021-01-06T19:05:48Z,1,I still haven't received them. Ordered in plenty of time for Christmas. Still nothing. It will be the last time I order from here.
PupSocks,2021-01-06T19:04:57Z,5,Very cute! Everyone loved their socks!
PupSocks,2021-01-06T19:03:52Z,3,"I’m disappointed in the quality of the sock itself.  It feels like some sort of nylon thing, more like stiff tights.   I bought two pair and neither of my boys wants to wear them because of the material."
PupSocks,2021-01-06T19:03:03Z,1,"I still have not received my order, despite the fact that I ordered it in November."
PupSocks,2021-01-06T19:02:17Z,4,The blanket is adorable.  I only wish that the background color was on both sides of the blanket instead of plain white on the back.
PupSocks,2021-01-06T18:59:04Z,5,Placing the order and uploading my photos was very simple. The order was delivered in plenty of time for Christmas.  My husband loved the socks with our pets pictures on them.
PupSocks,2021-01-06T18:56:45Z,4,"The image and service was good. The material and quality of the socks is not so great. Would not order again, but it was a good one time novelty gift."
PupSocks,2021-01-06T18:56:06Z,4,"If I were to give a review based just on the product, I would be giving five stars. It was a little rocky getting going. I placed my order on November 25, with the understanding that it would take a short period of time, a couple of weeks max, to receive my order. I started getting a little concerned around the second week of December and started inquiring. I was assured that my order would ship in time to be received by Christmas. Finally, the weekend before Christmas, I requested a refund. I was completely frustrated by this point as I would’ve appreciated long ago, if my gift was not going to be here in time, just some simple communication of that.  In the end, I was issued a refund and my socks and blanket to still be delivered free of charge. I just received my order yesterday and could not be more excited about the blanket! Absolutely perfect! And so incredibly soft!"
PupSocks,2021-01-06T18:54:29Z,1,The socks weren't cut right so they don't fit my feet properly. Also I didn't like the fabric used.
PupSocks,2021-01-06T18:53:33Z,5,"Got as a gift for my daughter and had two pics included of her two cats. Got a blanket, socks, and a mask.  After shipping delays, we finally got them, and they're fantastic!  She's very happy.  Great quality, and looks great.  Would buy again! Steve"
PupSocks,2021-01-06T18:52:50Z,1,"I got the wrong order two weeks ago and they still have not responded or tried to fix it. I was unable to give this as a Christmas gift, which was very disappointing."
PupSocks,2021-01-06T18:49:18Z,5,"Funny product, good idea for families"
PupSocks,2021-01-06T18:49:13Z,1,"I placed my order on 12/03/2020 hoping it would arrive for Christmas, I made multiple attempts to inquire on my order status, never received a response. Today they decided to ship my order."
PupSocks,2021-01-06T18:48:47Z,2,The picture turned out great.  However the socks are HUGEEEEEEEEEE I even tried to shrink them in the wash but no luck.  Sadly my husband will never be able to wear them.  He had a 9 size shoe but the socks would fit a size 13 better..... uggggg
PupSocks,2021-01-06T18:47:16Z,1,"I paid $60 for a blanket that I ordered 2 months ago that has yet to be delivered. I have tried contacting customer service several times with no success. I got an alert a week after I ordered it that it was on its was to the usps facility, and unless my package blew out of a window and landed in a pond, it never got there. If I could give no stars, I would."
PupSocks,2021-01-06T18:45:59Z,5,"Pup socks did an excellent job of extracting a dog’s face from a difficult picture. The socks came in a timely manner and look great. I highly recommend Pup Socks, and would use them again."
PupSocks,2021-01-06T18:45:50Z,2,"The product was good but it was intended as a Christmas gift and ordered in November. On the website I felt assured that a Christmas arrival was no problem. We didn't receive it until January 6. I know some things are beyond your control, but choosing who handles your shipping isn't one of them."
PupSocks,2021-01-06T18:45:28Z,5,"These were a gift to my daughter for Christmas, we did not anticipate her reaction to be so emotional, she LOVED her socks with her pups on them, she made us all cry and laugh it was truly a great Christmas morning. We will definitely be ordering more items in the future, very well done. Thank you."
PupSocks,2021-01-06T18:44:58Z,2,"Ordered in November, it is now January and I still haven’t heard anything about my order. Not satisfied at all"
PupSocks,2021-01-06T18:44:57Z,1,"I ordered a 4-pack of socks on November 25, allowing plenty of time as per your delivery promise, for my socks to arrive in time for Christmas. They did not and a I received a very 'weak' auto response on how the delivery company failed you. The socks were very expensive for their poor quality, but the impact of my children and husband to receive this gift featuring our beloved aging dog was lost since we were no longer together when the socks arrived a week after the holidays. Very disappointed."
PupSocks,2021-01-06T18:44:47Z,1,The socks never came!
PupSocks,2021-01-06T18:42:33Z,4,"Such a cute idea and so easy to order. Slight issue with delivery, but these are strange times! They kept me posted and did the best they could. Going to order a face mask next!"
PupSocks,2021-01-06T18:41:04Z,1,"I was so disappointed in Pupsocks. I ordered as a gift for my brother in law, and the socks they delivered were incorrect. Had the wrong dog on the socks! So I reached out and they offered to resend a corrected pair... but when those were received it was the same pair of incorrect socks!The attention to detail or requests was lacking.I reached out to customer service via email several times with minimal response. My last request for a refund after the second mess-up was ignored. I won’t be ordering again"
PupSocks,2021-01-06T18:39:46Z,4,"The socks were a delight and very pleasantly received as a gift! My dog's face came out beautifully on the socks. However, the size seems to be one size fits all because they are quite large even though I ordered women's size 7-9."
PupSocks,2021-01-06T18:37:43Z,1,"I ordered socks from here on Nov. 24th and I waited patiently for over a month for them to be delivered. I was finally excited when I saw the bag in my mailbox on January 4th, to see that the bag had a hole in it and there were no socks in the package. I have reached out about this and haven't heard anything. I am very disappointed in the service. I do not recommend this product because they have been very unhelpful to me and took over a month to ship."
PupSocks,2021-01-06T18:37:18Z,1,Order was never delivered and it’s been over a month. Order was placed December 7th in hopes of being delivered before Christmas. It is now January 6th and I have yet to receive my $30 pair of socks... very unhappy. Will not be ordering from here again.
PupSocks,2021-01-06T18:36:27Z,1,"I ordered these Nov 24 and still don’t have them on Jan 6 - SIX WEEKS LATER!  They were supposed to be a Christmas present. Don’t buy. Also I made a small mistake in my order and contacted them within a couple hours of ordering to ask about fixing. Absolutely not, they were already done! So how come I still don’t have them 6 weeks later?!"
PupSocks,2021-01-06T18:32:04Z,5,Oh my god the blanket came out amazing .
PupSocks,2021-01-06T18:31:28Z,5,"the socks were great, my wife loved them"
PupSocks,2021-01-06T18:31:01Z,1,Took ~2 months to recieve order.
PupSocks,2021-01-06T18:30:07Z,5,So cute!!!!!!! Boyfriend loved them.
PupSocks,2021-01-06T18:27:02Z,4,"The wrong socks were shipped, but pupsocks quickly responded to my request to send the correct pair. When they arrived, they were exactly what I was hoping for!"
PupSocks,2021-01-06T18:26:19Z,1,Still haven’t received my order after over 6 weeks.  Customer service is non-existent.  Would never order from here again.
PupSocks,2021-01-06T18:25:38Z,1,Did not specify that it would take weeks to arrive.
PupSocks,2021-01-06T18:24:35Z,3,Love the ease of ordering. Good communication. The socks are cute but not really feasible to wear. They are a novelty only. The materials they are made out of are low quality polyester. Not comfortable to wear. #sweatyfeet
PupSocks,2021-01-06T18:23:22Z,1,"I sent two different dog photos for two sets of socks. They arrived late and the result was abysmal. At no point was I contacted to say they had to change the photos or what would be on the socks. One had a portion of our dog's head; the other didn't even resememble an animal, never mind our dog."
PupSocks,2021-01-06T18:21:36Z,5,They were nice.
PupSocks,2021-01-06T18:20:47Z,1,Socks never received.  Please send refund or send socks.
PupSocks,2021-01-06T18:11:45Z,1,Where's my package? Its been over a month like wth? It was supposed to be a Christmas present but I guess it'll be on time for next year
PupSocks,2021-01-06T18:10:38Z,5,My order got stuck in customs. While waiting they sent a new order instead. Happy with the product and customer support.
PupSocks,2021-01-06T17:48:43Z,1,"Ordered Nov 24 (""expect to receive your order in 12-15 business days with international shipping""), shipped Dec 19, and latest tracking update was from Dec 24 in Miami somewhere (heading to Canada). At what point do I just get my money back?"
PupSocks,2021-01-06T17:39:48Z,1,Ordered over 1.5 months ago and still no socks.
PupSocks,2021-01-06T17:32:06Z,1,"I was so excited to order custom socks with our little pup's face on them for my husband for Christmas! I was so disappointed in PupSocks performance. It took nearly a month for me to receive the socks, and when I finally got them it wasn't even what I ordered! They simply used a stock photo of a dog that they clearly thought looked similar enough to our pup (and boy did it not look anything close to her). So the ""custom"" socks were a complete and total bust. I have been trying to get in touch with their customer service and have not gotten any response. I cannot recommend this product."
PupSocks,2021-01-06T17:29:00Z,5,"Great quality, pictures were perfect, fast shipping. Super happy!"
PupSocks,2021-01-06T17:21:40Z,2,"This is a really cute Idea, and the logistics that go into printing the images on a pair of socks is probably a more difficult task then most recognize, so 2 stars for the effort. I ordered 2 pair for my wife for Christmas hoping to be a good memory of our old dog, and a cute reminder of our 2 current pups. But honestly these just aren't worth the money. First, the socks themselves are not a good quality product, they are cheap and flimsy feeling. Don't think they'll last long. The quality and fit are no where near what you would expect from a decent pair of socks, even the ""small 4-6)"" size are big, loose, not fitting, and baggy on my wife's feet, she can wear them around the house, but no way are they fitting comfortably in shoes. When I put my size 10 feet in them, they fit my feet tight. The images on the socks are okay but not great. I wish they would send a ""proof"" for approval, I would have made a couple small changes or tried to get a better photo. I've worked with custom order companies in the past who have operated this way.Secondly these take FOREVER to actually arrive. The ""Lightning Fast Shipping"" claim on the site couldn't be more misleading. I ordered mine near the end of November and I just received them on Jan 5th. So they didn't make it in time for Christmas, or New Year, but they eventually got here. I understand that holidays are busy, covid has screwed up everything, but this timeline seemed a bit excessive, especially with no communication from the company except for this email on Dec 18th - ""Your order is scanned out of our facility before we release it to USPS, and it is confirmed to be in USPS possession – however they’ve advised us (and most e-commerce companies) that it may take up to 5 business days to sort and scan your order due to massively increased holiday volume and COVID-related delays.""Lastly, don't pay for the ""Custom Gift Packaging"". I fell for it and received a cheap gold box ""bottom"" with a flimsy clear plastic cover, which in itself is pretty crappy. However,  the paw print plastic bag it came in didn't protect it all and it was all bent and dented when it arrived. I do think the company could do better on the execution of sizing, shipping, product updates to customer, and fulfillment status. It's a cute idea, and probably a pain to execute well, there are some things that could be improved that would take things a long way towards a better product. But in my opinion, don't waste your money here."
PupSocks,2021-01-06T17:18:26Z,1,Awful material for socks. Also said ships 1 day to uk and it took 3 weeks.
PupSocks,2021-01-06T17:17:19Z,1,"Very disappointed with these socks. They took more than a month, almost a month and a half to come to my house. I asked for specifics and these were not met. I asked for a refund and never received a reply. I reached out several times and only heard back a generic message each time. I think the idea is cute but am not impressed with what I received. To be fair, the sock itself felt nice, but the toe portion did not fit well. Would not recommend, definitively not worth the price."
PupSocks,2021-01-06T17:15:30Z,1,"I ordered pair of PupSocks for my wife for Christmas on 12/4. The package arrived empty with a note from USPS that it had been received empty, essentially saying that the company mailed an empty package to me, not that it had fallen out during shipping. I reached out as soon as they arrived to get some kind of resolution, hoping that they might be able to still get there by Christmas if it was rushed, fully expecting that there wasn't going to be time. I attached images of the package and all of the details.The only response I got back is an email saying that they are overwhelmed by emails asking for status updates because USPS was backlogged. They didn't bother to read the information I gave them, or look at the picture. Frankly at this point I'm not even sure that the socks ever existed.All I would like, is to receive the socks that I paid for or at this point get a refund. I would be happy either way, currently I'm out of luck."
PupSocks,2021-01-06T17:11:35Z,3,Great first impression and very sweet sentimental present. However quality of socks is very low.
PupSocks,2021-01-06T17:01:13Z,1,"This is probably not a PupSocks issue, but a tracking label was created on 12/12/20.  Then no more tracking after that.  I have not received my order or have been contacted from PupSocks."
PupSocks,2021-01-06T16:53:44Z,2,"The socks look pretty good, but I ordered them in late November and only received them after Christmas, when I had actually needed them. If you're ordering from Canada then I'd suggest trying to find something that's local for more consistent shipping."
PupSocks,2021-01-06T16:44:31Z,3,"I ordered November 25th and have not yet received my order. It is stuck in Florida. Once I get them, maybe then I can give a better review."
PupSocks,2021-01-06T16:37:02Z,3,"The product turned out nice! However, took over a month to get to Canada."
PupSocks,2021-01-06T16:33:31Z,4,"they look good! photo a little blurred, but that could have been my fault. thanks!"
PupSocks,2021-01-06T16:32:39Z,5,Really fun socks!My kids loved them.
PupSocks,2021-01-06T16:30:20Z,1,"I’m very disappointed in my whole experience with Pupsocks. This looked to be a perfect Christmas gift for my boyfriend who is a Marine. He was able to come home for 2 weeks for Christmas so I made sure to order these over 1 month ahead of time. On pupsock’s website it said it takes around 8-10 days for the socks to be made and shipped. These socks were shipped only a few days before Christmas and due to the USPS delays, I just received my package- 1 week after my boyfriend had to go back on deployment. The socks look ok, picture is clear, but definitely not worth the wait."
PupSocks,2021-01-06T16:25:58Z,5,The socks looked great - fun gift
PupSocks,2021-01-06T16:25:48Z,1,I ordered custom printed socks with my face on them and received socks with a generic cat face on them. Emailed them and only received an automatic response with no reply since.
PupSocks,2021-01-06T16:21:32Z,3,"The product was great and my girlfriend loved her blanket, but the buying experience was beyond frustrating. The website said shipping in only a few days when I placed my order. My order was stuck in ""in production"" for nearly 2 weeks. I emailed customer service to get an update, and received no response for another 2 weeks. Before getting a response, I got an automated email regarding shipping with a tracking number. The order then sat at their facility without moving for several days. I reached out on twitter for help this time and it took an extensive amount of time again to get help. I ordered around thanksgiving to ensure christmas delivery and they barely made the deadline. Also, a week after receiving the product I got an email with the mockup of what the product would look like - something I clearly should've gotten long before. I don't know if I'd use this company again given this experience, even though the blanket was a hit with my girlfriend. I 100% get you guys were probably busy for the holidays but the response times were atrocious and your systems appear to be broken if I'm getting an email to review the mockup 2 weeks after I get the item in the mail."
PupSocks,2021-01-06T16:17:42Z,5,"Ordered these socks for my daughter with her cat on them for Christmas. She loves them. The face looks EXACTLY like her cat, and I loved that I could choose what color background the socks should be.  The socks are amazing and people love them when they notice them.  Super fun!"
PupSocks,2021-01-06T16:11:11Z,1,"Still waiting for order from November, it is now January.  I understand issues with the holiday rush and whatnot, but the order was placed in November and shipped on December 23rd.  It is now January 6, and no idea when delivery will occur.  Also, the mockup that was sent on Christmas Eve was not what was ordered, it did not follow the instructions sent with the order, so I don't know if what shows up will be right.  I then looked at your return policy and it notes that you have no requirement to fulfill the order as requested due to the ""quick"" turnaround on the product, which is kind of ridiculous in my opinion.  Even if Mcdonald's makes an error on their products, they send they remake the item properly to the original order.  Pretty much everyone does that, I think your company was the first I have ever seen that had that disclaimer.  Frustratingly, it is not mentioned at any time during the ordering process, but noted only when you are looking for resolutions to an issue.  Seems like a shady way to deal with errors on your part.  This is somewhat laughable as well, as it took almost a month to produce and during that time I received many emails from your company advertising that there was still time to order and receive prior to the Christmas holiday, which I believe would have been impossible seeing how I'm still waiting from a November order.  With that much time between the order and production, a proof could have been sent, or if the order was unclear, an email requesting clarification could be sent.  Also, I sent a communication once I received the mock and I have not heard back from the company yet.  All of this is quite frustrating and I'm sure it was due in part to the difficulties from COVID-19 and dealing with USPS.  To make it better, it would have been nice to have some clear communication through the process indicating where the order is in the process and also receiving a response for the inquiry would have been nice.  I'm sure no one will actually read this review either, so....  Also, if the proof sent out was wrong, then your team needs to work on your Quality Control/Quality Assurance program and implement some steps that would help ensure the proper product is made.  Overall, this has been a disappointing experience and luckily, I only made a small order first to see how the company produces and it will only be a small loss on my end.  If the order comes in incorrectly and your company will not correct the error as indicated on your website, then I will not use your service again, and I will not give any positive referrals.  I have been waiting for the product to submit this review, but I got tired of waiting."
PupSocks,2021-01-06T16:04:53Z,5,"Due to some unfortunate circumstances, the first attempt at shipping was foiled by a thief.  Nonetheless, they shipped me a replacement pair at no charge.  I feel this is above and beyond!  Made my daughters Christmas!"
PupSocks,2021-01-06T15:59:45Z,2,"The socks were delayed considerably, and the quality wasn't very good. The image of the dog is good, but the sock material is not comfortable."
PupSocks,2021-01-06T15:53:24Z,5,"Really loved the socks. Captured the face well, wish it could have been the whole body, but still cute!!!!"
PupSocks,2021-01-06T15:32:10Z,5,Soft enough to be your favorite blanket :)
PupSocks,2021-01-06T15:30:55Z,1,"I placed an order in November and It is now January 5, 2021 and I have not received my order. I contacted customer service twice and received an automated email. I am extremely disappointed."
PupSocks,2021-01-06T15:29:58Z,5,Adorable!  Image on socks came out exactly as I imagined.  Made an excellent gift for a loved one missing their dearly departed pet.
PupSocks,2021-01-06T15:27:08Z,2,"The image looked great but the socks fit terrible, they are a strange flat design and it would be hard to explain the fit but it was aweful."
PupSocks,2021-01-06T15:23:56Z,5,It was a bit on the expensive side but the result was so perfect that i forgot the price right away. The quality of the socks is really good and it is worth the wait my girlfriend started crying when she unboxed it
PupSocks,2021-01-06T15:21:52Z,5,"This are THE BEST SOCKS. I bought them for my husband for Christmas who loves our dogs more than life itself, in fact, maybe more than me. I sent in my pics- one of which had my dog in a Insta  Filter and PupSocks kept that intact and it totally worked. The socks were my husband’s favorite gift of the year, and he got a PlayStation 5. Thank you PupSocks! I will absolutely buy again."
PupSocks,2021-01-06T15:16:48Z,2,"Will change if needed but due to severe lack of communication and service I'm not impressed.  Placed my order on 4Dec, got update on 11Dec about pre-ship, have tried multiple times for update and only received one on 18Dec.  Still have not received order nor updated since then."
PupSocks,2021-01-06T15:06:09Z,1,"I received the wrong order, which isnt a huge deal especially given the holiday rush. However, I have contacted the company 5 times via the company website and ""contact form"". All emails have gone unanswered which is beyond terrible customer service. I highly recommend against using this company for anything going forward."
PupSocks,2021-01-06T15:04:42Z,1,"DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY. Placed my order for 3 items (2 blankets and 1 pair of socks) on 11/26/20. It is now 1/6/21, and I still have not received my items. I attempted to contact PupSocks several times via email and Facebook, but have not received a single response. So I have no items, and they have not refunded my $150."
PupSocks,2021-01-06T15:03:59Z,3,I ordered the socks before thanksgiving and just received them. Took way too long. Also the actual socks are thin and stiff and do not look or feel like a normal pair of socks.
PupSocks,2021-01-06T14:59:27Z,4,"The photos transferred to the mask were 5star the mask itself was not great/functional for me, if it was adjustable it would be better."
PupSocks,2021-01-06T14:58:51Z,5,"PupSocks are great!!  I have purchased 3 pairs to give as gifts, and they loved them!!  The picture quality was very clear!"
PupSocks,2021-01-06T14:54:48Z,2,"These socks are extremely poor quality. The printing was well done, and of course they're funny because they have my sister's dog's face on them, but I can't imagine anyone actually wanting to wear these socks. They're made of some kind of ultra cheap material that doesn't seem to be meant for actual wear. Which means that after the initial laugh from the gift recipient upon opening, I'm sure these are going in the trash. I'm very surprised they're made in Georgia—this isn't the quality you would expect from an American company. They were also not delivered in time for Christmas, but I could have overlooked that if the product itself was satisfactory. Not a happy customer. I'm never buying anything from an Instagram advertisement again."
PupSocks,2021-01-06T14:53:41Z,2,The socks arrived before Christmas so that was the good part.  The bad part is that one side of the socks was printed backwards and the socks do not fit and are not shaped like traditional socks.  I've reached out to customer service via email twice and have not gotten any responses from them.
PupSocks,2021-01-06T14:45:58Z,2,I ordered on 12/1 4 pairs of socks for Christmas presents. They were sent our 12/16 and I was suppose to get them 12/27... I STILL DON’T HAVE THEM! If you email them they just send you a form email from the CEO ... I have sent 4! No phone # and no way to get in touch with them! I went to the PO and they said it looks like the label was wrong!
PupSocks,2021-01-06T14:29:23Z,5,They came out perfect!!
PupSocks,2021-01-06T14:29:04Z,5,Came back perfect.  Made the best gift to a friend who was missing her cute pug.  Would order pup socks again.
PupSocks,2021-01-06T14:28:10Z,1,I ordered blankets for Christmas gifts for my daughters on December 4th to make sure we have plenty of time to receive.  They did not arrive until New Year's Eve and one of the blankets is very poor quality. I attempted to call but no phone number was available.  I emailed the week before Christmas and had not response for over a week.
PupSocks,2021-01-06T14:26:26Z,4,Product looks good.  Took way too long to receive.  A little expensive for the quality.
PupSocks,2021-01-06T14:22:19Z,5,Love the socks! The picture looks just like our Opie!
PupSocks,2021-01-06T14:21:57Z,1,Ordered these in November and have yet to receive them. Was suppose to be special Christmas gift for someone. Maybe for Valentine’s Day if they ever show up
PupSocks,2021-01-06T14:21:06Z,5,"Product was, surprisingly, exactly as shown. Delivered in a very reasonable amount of time. Very happy with the whole process and item. Wife loves them!"
PupSocks,2021-01-06T14:18:21Z,1,"I ordered2 pair of pupsocks and 1 mask and received an email they had shipped December 8, 2020. I still have not received Order #2512270."
PupSocks,2021-01-06T14:15:18Z,2,"The concept is great. My girlfriend LOVED them when she pulled them out of her stocking. The image of our dog was perfect. The company itself sent lots of informative notifications, which was also appreciated. However....The fabric of which the socks are made is not a normal sock material. It feels very synthetic and sheer. Fully understood that it is probably not easy to print quality images on normal cotton/woold/polyester, but still worth noting that it is odd. The fit is also not great. I ordered the correct size, but they still hang off the foot because of the lack of proper foot shaping. Finally, they aren’t terribly cheap. After shipping, ~$30 is a lot to spend for something that is not terribly comfortable. After you order you socks, you will be bombarded by marketing material from the company suggesting that you order more (obviously). Due to the quality of the sock, I highly doubt you could give more than one pair to the same person, so ultimately, this is just a gag gift."
PupSocks,2021-01-06T14:03:45Z,2,The product is great but I was extremely disappointed that my order didn't reach me until after Christmas when several people I know ordered weeks after I did and received their orders in time for Christmas.
PupSocks,2021-01-06T14:03:37Z,1,Ordered it in November and it didn’t even ship out until the 21st of December and they took forever to respond to my email. I’m not pleased and will not be ordering again.
PupSocks,2021-01-06T13:50:22Z,2,I wasn’t really happy with the quality of the socks - I thought they would be more of a natural fibre and would have a better fit
PupSocks,2021-01-06T13:47:03Z,3,Package did not arrive by the time promised.  Shipping label was printed 12/14 and wasn't received by post office until 12/22.  Packaging was horrible - cheap shipping bags - mine camed ripped and it is no wonder the contents didn't fall out.  Customer service would not answer emails.
PupSocks,2021-01-06T13:44:24Z,3,"The quality of the replication of the photo of my dog did come out really good but the mask material is small for an adult face. It did take a month to receive my order and I do understand since it is a custom gift, that it would take longer however, there should be some type of notice before submitting the order that it could take up to 4 weeks...I don't recall seeing that but if you did indicate it and I missed it, sorry!"
PupSocks,2021-01-06T13:38:14Z,1,"The worst customer service I've ever received. Hands down. I placed an order, which took forever to arrive and when I tried to reach out for assistance, I got stock answers and shoddy response times. The quality of the blanket isn't even that good; you can tell the color is just painted on a plain white blanket. A week after Christmas, I received ANOTHER blanket. It was the same exact one! I emailed them to ask them about it and just never received a response back. I work in Customer Service, and if I gave this level of horrid service to my customers, I wouldn't have a job."
PupSocks,2021-01-06T13:32:59Z,3,I placed 2 orders only 1 day apart. Got my first order & loved it. Still haven’t received my second order (for the exact same thing). Very disappointed.
PupSocks,2021-01-06T13:14:57Z,5,So clever!!  We had a great time Christmas morning opening the socks. Love them
PupSocks,2021-01-06T13:11:39Z,1,I still have not received my order. Very disappointed I ordered in November and was told it would be here before Christmas. It is now January 6 and still have not received order.Will never order from this company again.I want a refund!!!!!
PupSocks,2021-01-06T13:07:38Z,5,These are the perfect gift for a pet parent. Thank you so much for our socks!
PupSocks,2021-01-06T13:02:59Z,1,"The negative review is not in regards to how long it took for the package to arrive..I realize it’s covid. It was that one of the socks had a big snag in them , another the dog had the top of his head cut off, and the other two pairs were mixed up had had a dog with a cat bone and a cat with a dog bone on it. Very disappointing and no response from company regarding this."
PupSocks,2021-01-06T13:00:20Z,1,"I ordered a pair of socks for the holidays which I was assured would arrive by 12/21.  Not only did they not arrive in time for Christmas, I still have not gotten them.  The package came on 12/28, empty with nothing inside.  I have sent three emails to the company trying to remedy this situation and have received no responses.  There is no contact number so I am literally out the money and never received the item."
PupSocks,2021-01-06T12:49:29Z,5,"I ordered 3 pairs, 2 dogs and 1 cat.  They arrived quickly and came out great.  After seeing how nice they came out ordered 2 more pairs.  One more dog and one was of a goat.  Again they came out great."
PupSocks,2021-01-06T12:33:52Z,1,"The socks are a weird shape and material, so you can't actually wear them. I ordered white and they came with spots of yellow discoloration, mostly on the edges where they were folded but other spots as well. The notes I left for the designer, on how I wanted the faces trimmed, were not followed. I emailed inquiring about how to return them and get a refund, I never heard from them. Terrible company when it comes to communicating. And the product is definitely not worth the price they charge."
PupSocks,2021-01-06T12:24:19Z,1,Haven’t gotton my pakage yet its been almost 2 months
PupSocks,2021-01-06T12:17:53Z,1,Pup socks ordered on Nov 24th - went into production & stayed there till I sent a message over 3 weeks later asking why - did not get a response for over a week but the next day said shipped -still Not Received - I ordered because my daughter showed me as she purchased 2 days prior - she still did not receive hers either - please do not blame the Pandemic - it should never take that long -i have received other shipments via mail in that time - if so then you should have stated so on the website - ordering 5 weeks prior to Christmas should be sufficient- thanks
PupSocks,2021-01-06T11:20:19Z,4,"The picture quality was great, but the sock quality is lacking. It was a gift for a sock-and-pet-lover, and they were obviously confused (because the socks are thin, without added plush/softness), until they recognized the cat.  And even then the recipient noted relief cause the socks alone are not desirable socks.  Picture easily recognizable though."
PupSocks,2021-01-06T09:46:34Z,2,"I did not receive the socks/ facemask in time to give as the gift they were intended to be. Instead I received an email with the mock up of each.  The socks were correct, and the mask mock up is missing one of the two dogs it was supposed to have on it. SO, you can see my dismay.  I didn't even use the mock ups because they were only half right.I recognize that the USPS is to be blamed for the late delivery, but Pupsocks can choose delivery providers who are more reliable, like FedEx, if they want to. I am still hopeful that the mock up was just in error and the mask is correct.  If not, 50% correct, and late is what I got."
PupSocks,2021-01-06T09:33:24Z,3,"The quality of these socks is quite low. The material isn't great quality, and they're shaped like squares. The price is quite high given the low quality material. The print is adorable, but ... I feel like for the price, the socks should be better."
PupSocks,2021-01-06T09:18:49Z,1,I ordered socks with my dogs face on them and you guys sent me socks with a gray cat. I’ve been trying to contact you via email and have not gotten a response.
PupSocks,2021-01-06T08:45:33Z,1,I never received my product!! Still waiting for it - it's 8 weeks now =(
PupSocks,2021-01-06T08:04:57Z,1,Do not buy. Customer service is awful they refuse to respond. Package shipped nearly a month ago and still not arrived and has no ETA. Pup socks said they would work with us and send the item through another carrier if it did not make any progress soon. After another week we reached out and they are no longer responding.
PupSocks,2021-01-06T07:08:37Z,5,This was a gift and stole Christmas. She couldn’t stop talking about them and said now I can show people what my pup looks like. It is a great item for a pet owner.
PupSocks,2021-01-06T06:53:07Z,1,"I have placed my order over 5 weeks ago and still have not received anything as of yet,  very disappointing"
PupSocks,2021-01-06T05:19:29Z,1,"I still have not gotten my order for over a month now. I have reached out a handful of times and got one response. There was a tracking number given but it is still waiting for pickup from USPS. So it is technically still at the place it was made and has been like that for weeks. I asked for a refund and still have not gotten a response. Will probably never use again. What I thought would be a good birthday gift, and then thought would be a good Christmas, then new years....now it isn't even worth trying to give it to the original person."
PupSocks,2021-01-06T05:15:21Z,1,"Though I understand that the holiday season was busy, I have not received my socks nor had responses to four emails. Sad, I was extremely excited for this product."
PupSocks,2021-01-06T05:13:23Z,1,"When I placed my initial order before the holidays, the shipping time frame I was quoted would have put my socks arriving no later than Dec 18th. But the 18th came and went and still no socks or updated shipping info from the company. I finally received an email on Dec 24th apologizing for the shipping delay and a promise that my socks would arrive in the next week. They did arrive the following week but when I opened the package, I was sent a pair of socks with some other family’s dog!!!  I have emailed them about receiving the wrong socks but have yet to get a reply from them."
PupSocks,2021-01-06T03:51:26Z,5,Shipping is not as quick as they lead on BUT well worth the wait! Good quality (both photo clarity and material) and my husband loved receiving them. Such a fun gift!
PupSocks,2021-01-06T03:51:11Z,1,"These socks are cute because they have my dogs face all over them,  but that's where it ends. They are stiff, have zero stretch and are not comfortable at all. For the price I expected more. Would not order again. Wish I would have went with the blanket instead."
PupSocks,2021-01-06T03:46:57Z,5,Great product! The happiness on my gf face when she saw our two chinchillas on socks and a blanket was amazing!
PupSocks,2021-01-06T03:46:14Z,5,My son loved his blanket and socks.  It was the perfect gift!
PupSocks,2021-01-06T03:46:08Z,2,"I placed an order before Thanksgiving. On December 4th it said it was ready to ship and a label was created. It never moved from there. I tried contacting the company in mid December but got no where. Then I received a “proactive” email that they were going to replace my order because they saw it was stuck. Nothing was processed. It was a hopeful email that was never fulfilled. I finally got in touch with someone a few days before Christmas and they told me rest assured, my order would go out. The one that was stuck with a pre label shipment from Dec 4. I was OK with receiving the item after Christmas. I understand things were crazy. After Christmas passed and the items never moved I reached back out. After a few days they finally offered a replacement or a refund. I requested a refund because we are moving and wouldn’t get the replacement in time. This was Dec 26 and it’s January 5. I’ve yet to receive an answer from them that it has been processed. I’ve followed up twice. I know how bad things are with shipping due to COVID. I tried really hard to be patient. And I was flexible. The lack of follow through and response is what has me upset."
PupSocks,2021-01-06T03:10:10Z,1,The socks are extremely uncomfortable. The printed picture of my dog is low quality.
PupSocks,2021-01-06T03:01:22Z,3,Experience was ok. One major disappointment was the laziness of the crop of my cat's picture regardless of detailed instructions to designers. You can tell they have one template and really don't go the extra mile to capture the uniqueness of your pet.
PupSocks,2021-01-06T02:47:38Z,1,"To be honest, I expected a “normal” sock quality... what we received was quite the opposite! They are the strangest material I’ve ever seen. I understand that maybe something is needed to be able to print on them but it’s terrible fitting material and they are the most uncomfortable sock we’ve owned. We wasted our money as we literally cannot even wear them they are so bad in fit! Not to mention that it took over 6 weeks to arrive. Definitely disappointed. Wanted to love them..."
PupSocks,2021-01-06T02:38:51Z,5,Very thankful that the socks arrived on Christmas Eve! My son’s girlfriend loved her unique gift. Thank you!
PupSocks,2021-01-06T02:37:23Z,1,Order placed Nov 24. Jan 6 still nothing. All inquiries are met with an automated response. My advise would be NOT to order. Money down the drain.
PupSocks,2021-01-06T02:36:01Z,1,"Horrific. Total scam. Paid extra to have shipment received by 12/22. Arrived a week late. When it did arrive it was a blanket with someone else’s dogs on it, not mine. I have emailed several times for resolution/refund, and I have received no response. I’ve filed a dispute with PayPal and hope that I will get justice, as this type of unscrupulous behavior and horrible treatment to paying customers seems to be this company’s only way of doing business."
PupSocks,2021-01-06T02:33:04Z,1,I ordered on December 5 and still have not received my order as of today January 5
PupSocks,2021-01-06T02:27:25Z,5,Fabulous socks! The socks was a gift and my daughter loved seeing her fur-baby image on the socks!
PupSocks,2021-01-06T02:23:39Z,1,Completely frustrated.  Still waiting receipt of an order placed on December 8th ... one of the items was a Christmas gift for my son who has already returned to his home out of state (so when my order one day does arrive I get to pay to ship them again).  Sent an email inquiry to the company but only received a generic bulk email response.  Very disappointed.
PupSocks,2021-01-06T02:14:15Z,3,The socks I ordered were great until they were tried on. The sizing is totally off and was way too big in the foot area but too tight in the ankle area. Very strange and kind of disappointing:/ the pictures of the pet were really clear so at least that was good.
PupSocks,2021-01-06T02:13:18Z,1,Blanket quality of pictures was not up to an acceptable standard and the socks didn’t even have the right dog on them
PupSocks,2021-01-06T02:04:15Z,1,Order took over a month to come when it was supposed to be a Christmas present. Came a week into the new year only for it to be the wrong order and someone else’s socks with dogs on them. My order was a cat on the socks.
PupSocks,2021-01-06T02:01:47Z,5,We love our pup socks. Our dog’s photo was perfectly displayed and the socks are great quality with a good weight and stretch. They even addressed my request to edit an imperfection in the photo. It was a perfect gift for my pup loving daughter.
PupSocks,2021-01-06T02:01:38Z,2,"I had ordered about a month away from Christmas, and granted taking in COVID, shipping from US to Canada, postal delivery delays, etc. aside, I was moreso disappointed with the quality of the socks, and the images. I had a friend who told me their order (pre-COVID) also took a while to arrive and ordered three months in advance, and were happy with their order. I wasn't sure what I was expecting, and though it did bring a good laugh as the gift (socks) was intended to bring joy, I don't think I will order again. This is a great gift idea, that I'm sure many others have enjoyed through their purchases."
PupSocks,2021-01-06T02:01:19Z,1,"Ordered Dec 6th 2020 still not received, said 7days otherwise wouldn't had ordered. Tracking says label made & still waiting for package to mail. Regret ignoring my instincts on not using this FB advertised service. Was intended for Xmas."
PupSocks,2021-01-06T02:00:26Z,1,I’m asking to give a review on items I haven’t even received. I will never ever order anything from them again! Ordered early December said they would be here before Christmas. I get a notification on Christmas Eve I believe they won’t be here until the 2nd... it’s how the 5th and we still don’t have them. And I can’t get ANYONE to respond to me.
PupSocks,2021-01-06T01:54:01Z,5,The Pup socks made a perfect Christmas gift!  My daughter loved them!   Super cute & well made!
PupSocks,2021-01-06T01:51:37Z,4,I ordered socks with a picture of our cat for my daughter for Christmas and they turned out great!! She was was surprised and loved them. The socks are long and sturdy great for the winter!!
PupSocks,2021-01-06T01:44:38Z,5,Socks were a BIG holiday hit!
PupSocks,2021-01-06T01:43:16Z,1,The socks were made with the wrong picture on them. They did not read the special instructions. They do not contact me when I sent an email to them telling them the problem. I’ve been waiting a month already and no socks yet!! I am not impressed at all!!
PupSocks,2021-01-06T01:40:46Z,1,"Ordered custom socks and a mask with my husbands dog on it Dec 3rd for Christmas. It’s now January 5th still haven’t received socks and there is no one that you can call. I’ve emailed the customer service and still have no answers as to where the remainder of my order is. Received the mask (which is adorable) on Dec 11th and when I track my order it says it is complete- but it’s not. Just shows my track number for the face mask even though it states that items will be shipped separately. Very disappointed as I love supporting small independent businesses, especially one that gives back to dogs! At this point even if I have to wait another month for the socks, oh well. However, I can’t even get an answer if they are still trying to fill the rest of my order and that I’ll eventually receive the socks. I did receive an email from the CEO stating that they were trying to fill all orders but were very behind. Then I was sent a mock up of what the socks will look like (which I showed my happy on Xmas day). I appreciated the follow up but really wasn’t any type of answer."
PupSocks,2021-01-06T01:34:06Z,5,"The socks came out even better than I expected!  They took a long time to arrive but I think that was the post office’s fault.  PupSocks gave me so many updates on when they were processed, shipped, etc and even sent a mock-up when they weren’t going to show up by Christmas.  I would highly recommend PupSocks!"
PupSocks,2021-01-06T01:27:41Z,5,The socks look great! I will definately be ordering more pairs.
PupSocks,2021-01-06T01:27:19Z,4,"The customer service, speed with which I received my order and quality of the socks were all terrific. My only complaint is the length of the socks, they sit in between the ankle and knee, which my son and I find is a very awkward length. If you don't mind that, I would highly recommend PupSocks!"
PupSocks,2021-01-06T01:24:29Z,1,"Terrible socks, made with gross feeling materials, Picture of pet is severely distorted when you try and put them on.  Sizing is way to small worst money I ever spent on holiday gifts"
PupSocks,2021-01-06T01:21:53Z,1,Ordered December 2. Still haven’t received them. It’s January 5. No reply from the company regarding my inquiry.
PupSocks,2021-01-06T01:18:06Z,5,"Fit good, good color, image is sharp. Will buy again!"
PupSocks,2021-01-06T01:14:31Z,5,The socks came just as I expected! The image of the dog printed on really well and the recipient of them was REALLY excited. I highly recommend these as a gift to any pet lover.
PupSocks,2021-01-06T01:06:37Z,1,"Ordered prior to Thanksgiving. No update to order status until I was notified that it would not deliver before Christmas. The worse part was that when it did deliver the fabric is very elastic like and not comfortable, smells like plastic and doesn't form to feet like any other sock. It kind of resembles the rental socks you get for tuxedos or trampoline parks. Would not recommend and will not purchase from here again."
PupSocks,2021-01-06T01:01:54Z,5,I purchased these as a Christmas gift and they were a complete hit!  I would definitely refer others
PupSocks,2021-01-06T00:59:24Z,5,Mask fits kind of weird but it's SOOOOO CUTE. Love it.
PupSocks,2021-01-06T00:56:07Z,2,Bought as a Christmas gift they loved the design but was told they are uncomfortable.
PupSocks,2021-01-06T00:55:18Z,1,Ordered my socks in November and have not received them yet 1/5. I requested a refund and have not heard back from the company.
PupSocks,2021-01-06T00:52:56Z,5,"Turned out great and arrived just in time for their intended for Christmas.The receivers of the gift seemed happy with the gift.The printing was well done, the colours were bright and the material was soft.Best of all I appreciate how a portion of the proceeds helps the Human Society.Thank you and keep doing what you're doing!"
PupSocks,2021-01-06T00:51:45Z,1,I ordered my socks December 4th and still have to received.  I reached out to the company on 12/21 and received a generic email response from the CEO.  I have gotten no further communication.  Beware of this company
PupSocks,2021-01-06T00:35:30Z,1,Never received my order.
PupSocks,2021-01-06T00:34:10Z,2,"I ordered at the beginning of December for Christmas Presents.  I did not get my order until this week.  If you are not going to be able to deliver orders until a month later, that should be stated when someone is ordering them."
PupSocks,2021-01-06T00:32:23Z,5,Daughter (29 yo) loved these socks with her babies on there.. Made me a hero lol.
PupSocks,2021-01-06T00:27:01Z,1,"Their 5-8 day shipping was actually 26 days, then they blamed the post office. Couldn't cancel my order because the customer service is non existent."
PupSocks,2021-01-06T00:25:59Z,1,"Delayed shipping, zero communication, took weeks to reply to an enquiry about where my order was. Missed Xmas and when the socks finally showed up they were the wrong size and bad quality. Do not recommend using this company."
PupSocks,2021-01-06T00:20:06Z,1,Ordered back in November and still hasn't arrived yet.
PupSocks,2021-01-06T00:16:49Z,5,I purchased 3 cat blankets and 1 dog blanket for Christmas presents and all the recipients were very happy with them! The blankets are so soft and cozy. I'm hoping someone will send me one for my upcoming birthday......
PupSocks,2021-01-06T00:12:02Z,1,I placed my order on 12/4 for my 12 yr old daughter to have by Christmas and still have never received it. It’s Jan 5th. I have emailed pupsocks several times about the status of my order and have yet to receive a response. I will be contacting my credit card to void the amount I paid over a month ago. Ridiculous!!!
PupSocks,2021-01-06T00:00:45Z,1,Horrible product.  Do not purchase the socks.  The picture quality is great but the sock itself is terrible.  It’s a tight nylon that doesn’t shape the foot. You can’t even get your foot inside as the opening is so tight.   The heel part is awkwardly placed and it’s almost an ankle sock.  I have tried to contact customer service via email and and text and have had no response at all.  I am very disappointed. My son said that they are the worst feeling sock he’s ever received. This will not be worn.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T23:54:36Z,1,Never received my order!
PupSocks,2021-01-05T23:54:33Z,2,The quality of the material is very nice .. unfortunately I did not get the blanket I ordered and not getting a response from Pupsocks to resolve the error.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T23:48:57Z,1,The quality of the socks is AWFUL. They are completely unwearable and totally overpriced. After contacting them to complain they blocked me from their social media accounts. Shame.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T23:46:54Z,5,My husband loves the socks! I had both of our fur babies faces featured on them and they came out perfect. The material also seems very durable and soft. Thanks!
PupSocks,2021-01-05T23:35:06Z,5,"These socks are great, my son has 2 pairs and loves them. Sent a pair to my niece and she thinks they are the best socks ever!"
PupSocks,2021-01-05T23:33:39Z,1,"I never buy things from sponsored links on social media, but these socks looked so cute that I couldn't resist. While the puppy images look great, the socks themselves are horrible. They have absolutely no shape and no elasticity in the right places so they are just loose and baggy around the feet, ankles, and calves. A total rip off."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T23:33:00Z,1,I would love to be able to give these socks an accurate review however even though I ordered them well before Christmas they still haven’t arrived. When I placed the order it said they would arrive before Christmas and all the info the tracking number provides is “in transit” so I have no clear idea when they will be here. Also at $25 per pair they were not cheap.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T23:30:08Z,1,"Picture is a blob with a seam/fold right down the center. I understand that creating something with a black dog is difficult however it turned out quite badly - if this is something that couldn't have been done successfully then I would expect to be told that there were difficulties and able to either cancel the order or submit another image. What quality control is in place. To top it off the blanket with huge black blobs printed all over must have had fold in it as it was printed as there is a white seam over a large portion of the center. Considering the cost of the product, I am disappointed in the result."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T23:29:41Z,5,Was a big hit.  Loved it very much.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T23:28:59Z,1,Customer service is great which is why this review gets one star. Otherwise zero stars would be more appropriate to reflect the zero satisfaction of the product. The quality is TERRIBLE! Material feels like plastic and the size is very wonky. Would not recommend. Too bad because if the quality was better (which it should be for a pair of $30 socks) this gift would have been a hit. In the end customer service does not mean much of the item received is junk.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T23:24:27Z,1,"It took forever to get this to Canada, bad quality and instead of our pup and baby on the socks I got some random rooster."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T23:21:58Z,5,Husband loved these as a christmas stocking gift! These socks bring a smile to his face and that was the goal. Thank you!
PupSocks,2021-01-05T23:19:28Z,3,"I liked the socks, but I ordered them on 12/7 and didn't receive them until 1/4, even though I was assured via the website that I would receive them before Christmas."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T23:18:26Z,5,I bought a pair of socks and a blanket for my daughter. The quality was great! She loved the gift!!
PupSocks,2021-01-05T23:11:54Z,2,"I’m disappointed. Received one month after ordering, and it’s the wrong size. Not worth the $30 for what was supposed to be a thoughtful gift."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T23:11:35Z,5,These were a gift for my father-in-law. He is “Papa” to our dog Shadow. The two are inseparable. My father-in-law LOVED the socks and loves that he can take Shadman with him wherever he goes! Thank you for such an amazing product and quick turn around when ordering!
PupSocks,2021-01-05T23:08:19Z,1,"I placed my order the end of November, it’s now the beginning of January ...there’s absolutely no indication my socks are even in progress."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T23:08:10Z,1,"I can’t honestly review something I haven’t received now can I? The package was ordered on December 7th, supposedly shipped on the 11th, has been stuck at the York USPS FACILITY since the 16th. Only good thing was that I received a printout from your company that I could present as a stand in for the Christmas present. That was thoughtful. What I really want is to receive the product I paid for nearly a month ago."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T23:06:52Z,1,"Ordered on Dec 1 finally after getting emails from Pup Socks for 2 years :-) as a present to a relative.   Received notification that the blanket shipped on Dec 12th and would arrive Before Christmas.  About 10 days later I received notification that it would arrive on Dec 28th...After Christmas...and it never showed up.  Today is Jan 5th and the tracking has shown the blanket in Atlanta since Dec 12th.  I have emailed 4 times and each time I get a long automated response back from the CEO apologizing for the long wait time for the package and they are working hard and will get back to me soon.  Nobody has ever emailed me back.  Each time I have emailed I get the same auto responder.  There is no phone number on your website to call.  From the lack of communication on your end it looks like you dropped the ball by taking on more than you could handle.  Given the length of time I have waited and all the attempted communication it is evident that you have a real a mis-managed mess to deal with.  As for the relative that is waiting on the blanket, I went ahead and sent a gift card today from Best Buy so he will finally get his Christmas Present from me on January 8th.  Best Buy doesn't cut corners so I am 100% sure the card will get there when they say it will.  I know because I sent a gift card to someone else around Dec 10th to the exact same address and it arrived on time."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T22:59:24Z,5,"The socks came much later than expected, but the company was very good at communicating the delay.  The quality of the socks and images of our doggos was very good."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T22:55:38Z,2,"Shipment just arrived today. Ordered in early December. Socks are not fitting for a kid, and are the most uncomfortable material ; I’ve truly never felt socks this awful."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T22:54:44Z,1,The image of our dog was great but the socks were weirdly shaped and bunched up at the top of the foot making them unwearable.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T22:51:24Z,3,"Did a good job of placing the photo (unlike some companies that distort the pix) and were fairly quick to get them made and shipped. But, the socks themselves are garbage. Recipient laughed and thought they were cute--i just can't imagine them ever actually WEARING these cheap socks."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T22:47:14Z,5,My kids LOVED their socks! A great stocking stuffer for them :)
PupSocks,2021-01-05T22:46:56Z,1,Havent received my order over a month
PupSocks,2021-01-05T22:45:28Z,2,We found the socks we ordered were not the quality we thought they were going to be for the price and the picture did not come out very well. If the copy we provided was not good enough we wished that customer service or contact could have been made to have the best possible outcome Overall pretty disappointed and it was a gift for our roommate too so we weren't very impressed.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T22:42:26Z,1,Did not receive.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T22:42:11Z,1,Ordered in November and is now January and the socks still have not arrived and no response to multiple emails
PupSocks,2021-01-05T22:39:28Z,1,I have yet to revive my product. I was sent two incorrect blankets. I’ve contacted the company multiple times and have yet to receive a refund
PupSocks,2021-01-05T22:33:14Z,5,Came out perfect!
PupSocks,2021-01-05T22:30:49Z,3,"The socks themselves were great.  The order took MUCH longer, however, then I had been led to believe.  I ordered Mid-November, then I had to remind them of it and they said they would speed it up and give me a credit.  (I don’t believe they actually gave me the refund they promised.). They didn’t ship until Dec 21.  It wasn’t their fault however that USPS took 10 days to get it to me from Atlanta.  Overall, I’m happy with the product, but unhappy with the process itself.  Go ahead and order and you’ll be fine, but allow a LOT of time."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T22:30:06Z,1,"Absolutely shocking and experience with this company, I ordered socks at the beginning of November at the end of December they had still not arrived and I complained to customer services it took them several days to reply to my complaint. They told me my product had been lost almost a month prior to this conversation and they hadn’t done anything about it, so now 2 days before Christmas they are going to get a new product made( not much use seen as it was a Christmas present). Following this I then received another email from a different colleague in the new year stating he had issued me with 1/2 a refund ( he couldn’t refund me for the personalisation that I didn’t receive). Terrible customer service they need to get their stories straight and keep to their promises. Such a rip off."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T22:27:36Z,1,"Terrible quality. The 'socks' are not fit for feet, in dimension or material. The material is very cheap synthetic and not breathable. Overpriced, very poor product. Disappointed. 0 stars."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T22:20:55Z,2,"I ordered these as a gift for my wife.  The socks arrived very late.  I received a notice on Dec 14th that the socks had shipped.  However, the tracking status showed that had yet to be picked up by the carrier until the 22nd or 23rd (I can't remember the exact date).  Needless to say, they did not arrive until after Christmas.  I did receive an email on the 24th with a mock up of the socks and a 40% off of my next purchase coupon.Neither of us were impressed with the quality of socks.  Honestly, I'm not sure why I paid $50 (discounted) for two pair of socks.  Anybody want a 40% off coupon?"
PupSocks,2021-01-05T22:18:31Z,1,Never received my order. Customer support wasn't helpful either.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T22:15:43Z,5,"The cat blankets I ordered came out perfect!  The pictures were very clear and blankets were very soft and good quality.  My only negative remark is they took a long time to arrive.  They were a gift and I didn’t receive on time but it was the holiday season, other than that great product!"
PupSocks,2021-01-05T22:13:00Z,5,"We absolutely love the products we bought, 2 pairs of socks & a blanket. The customer service department was amazing. They had to contact me about a mistake I made on the order and made certain this didn’t effect the shipping time since it was all for Christmas. I will highly recommend your amazing company."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T22:07:01Z,2,"Honestly, they’re ok. Their production time was WAAAAAY slower than anticipated and advertised. I ordered 1 pair of custom socks on 11/30 and they arrived 12/26. Anyways, I gave leeway since it’s COVID times and the holidays. The socks finally arrived and they did NOT feel like socks. They’re a strange material that doesn’t stretch much and they don’t look like they will stay up. They’re a gift for my dad and he said he liked them, but I won’t be ordering another pair."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T22:04:20Z,1,"Cheap socks, adjusted my photo. If I could give zero stars, I would. Pup socks are made with an odd fabric that looks and feels cheap. Not soft. But worse than that is the complete disaster this company made of my puppy’s photo by cutting and pasting ears and teeth onto the image. Why?? I didn’t request it and certainly didn’t approve it. Don’t waste $30!!"
PupSocks,2021-01-05T22:02:09Z,5,"I ordered on the last day it said to grantee a before Christmas delivery and true to advertising, I received the socks on the 23rd. I’m happy with how the images of both dogs came out. I will be ordering more in the future."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T21:59:44Z,3,"The images were great but the quality of the socks was left to be desired. Long delivery time over the holidays which was expected. They emailed a virtual card for me to print out and I gifted that while waiting for the actual product. Just wish the socks were better quality. The recipient had a difficult time getting them on as there is no stretch and I’ve never seen this material before. A fun idea, not practical as a sock."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T21:57:39Z,5,"Even during the holiday season the ordering and shipping seemed quick. The socks I chose are a little large for my husband even though I chose his size, but he loves them!"
PupSocks,2021-01-05T21:54:40Z,1,They sent the wrong socks!!!
PupSocks,2021-01-05T21:51:15Z,3,"Ordering and delivery was good. Quality of the printing was also superb. I was not impressed with the color selection for men's socks. I bought these socks as a gift. Although the recipient was fine with the color I chose, we were a little disappointed with the sock itself. The fabric does not give and is not breathable.   But, the design with the cat's face is very cute."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T21:47:44Z,2,I found that the socks don’t fit true to size. I got a medium for a men’s shoe size of 9 and they were very tight and barely fit.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T21:37:47Z,5,Good quality and not too long to wait
PupSocks,2021-01-05T21:34:48Z,5,Items were purr-fect!    They were Christmas presents and both recipients were delighted!   Thank you!
PupSocks,2021-01-05T21:31:19Z,4,The socks seem to be quality.  The cropping of one of my dog's face pics was odd (but not bad).  Next time I will crop them myself.I wish there was an opportunity to review before printing.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T21:25:27Z,5,The socks are adorable!! I gave them as a Christmas gift and the recipient loved them!
PupSocks,2021-01-05T21:20:32Z,5,Socks were beautiful and arrived quickly.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T21:13:46Z,4,The reason I couldn't give you guys 5 stars is because I supposed to got a blanket and socks I never received my socks but the blanket was perfect
PupSocks,2021-01-05T21:07:49Z,2,photo came out great but socks are not comfy - way stiffer than expected and aren't soft. I don't know if I'll be wearing them as planned:(
PupSocks,2021-01-05T21:06:30Z,1,Order was damaged and company will not respond to my inquiries.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T21:03:14Z,1,Never actually received my order
PupSocks,2021-01-05T21:01:21Z,1,"Ordered a few months ago, still have not come in, reached out via email about a week ago to see what was going on with no response except for an email asking me to rate their service, so thats an easy 1-star from me."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T21:01:04Z,1,The socks were straight tubes of polyester. Not formed or fit for real wear. They came a week after Christmas so not at the time promised at all. The dog face was a good likeness to my sons dog but other than that it was a complete waste of 30$!!!
PupSocks,2021-01-05T20:57:49Z,1,"They sent me the wrong product - masks with random cats and dogs, rather than my pet cat. The mock-up the emailed had the correct photo, but what they sent had nothing to do with the mock-up. After sending the wrong product, they make it extremely hard to get in touch by phone or email. I will amend this review IF and when they correct my order — but so far, this appears to be a fraudulent company that has no interest in satisfied customers — they are only interested in theft of your money."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T20:57:29Z,3,I ordered in nov I still don’t have order so ya there’s that
PupSocks,2021-01-05T20:50:58Z,5,"The blanket was soft and lovely, and the socks were fun. Both high quality. Very happy. Will order from here again."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T20:36:20Z,1,"Beyond disappointed with your company, as I ordered a pair of socks in November for my fiancé for Christmas and not only have they still to this day (jan5) not arrived but I’ve received no email updates or replies back to my email enquiries due to “being busy as a result of Covid” Was excited to support your company but now I just have a bad taste in my mouth, will not recommend your company and have paid you a high price for a pair of socks that I will likely never receive. Frustrated and annoyed non returning first time customer."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T20:31:37Z,2,"Thanks for the mockup email on 12/24 to share the intended gift. It is currently Jan. 5, 2021 and still have yet to receive the order. I would like a refund, if you cannot give me a tracking number and status update of my order. I understand you are a small business and are facing long delays with the current postal situation. Thank you,Betty"
PupSocks,2021-01-05T20:31:17Z,2,"The socks look good, the printing is nice, but they're just not functional as socks. Not soft, can't keep their shape... they're like baggy leggings. Not really what I was hoping for, but at least they got a good chuckle out of my wife."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T20:30:08Z,4,Definitely a fun keepsake.  Not exactly the most comfortable pair of socks I own.  But it is pretty rad having my favorite guy on them.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T20:29:02Z,1,Received the wrong order with someone else's dogs on both blankets I ordered.  After numerous emails I have yet to hear back from the company. The wrong blankets were received over 2 weeks ago and my Mom and best friend are still waiting to receive their Christmas presents.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T20:26:59Z,1,"Unfortunately the socks did not arrive in time for Christmas, despite a guarantee that they would AND the order being placed a month in advance! Once received I will admit the picture of my dog turned out well, except that the socks are completely UNWEARABLE. They are a very weird, slippery and shiny material and are super baggy. Also the fit for the length of the foot (toes to ankle) was completely off (for reference I wear a size eight in women's shoe). For a $30 pair of socks with my dog's adorable face I am so disappointed that I cannot wear them."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T20:22:09Z,1,Ordered over a month ago. Never got the product. Asked for refund and they won’t answer
PupSocks,2021-01-05T20:19:54Z,2,"We loved the idea of these socks and chose 2 images to put on the socks. The actual socks came and although the images look great on the fabric, the fabric is not really like any sock we've ever seen. The fabric feels like a compression sock and not really ideal for the average user. The socks fit weird and really are more of a novelty than an actual product for daily use. We were disappointed in the fabric quality, the fit. For the high price, we expected more. The actual sock also didn't really look like the photo of what was advertised."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T20:19:28Z,4,"The pup socks are adorable. The picture looks great and clear. The only reason I rated these 4 is the material. They are not warm and cozy, they are kind of silky. I guess that’s how they get the photo to show on the socks. Otherwise great gift and my daughter was thrilled!"
PupSocks,2021-01-05T19:51:34Z,1,Received the wrong socks with someone else’s pet. It was supposed to be a Christmas present for my husband and arrived late. I reached out to customer service with no response. I really wanted to like this company.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T19:51:29Z,1,"Ordered socks November 27th, FINALLY received the socks intended as Christmas Gifts January 5th, and my order was incorrect. 2 pairs out of 3 were correct, 1 pair was wrong...a cat, when I ordered a dog. Also, the fit is awful!!! I wore for 3 minutes and already slouching on the calf, and stretched out. Material is cheap, and feels gross, definitely not made from quality materials. Not worth what I paid, and I’m embarrassed to give these overly expensive crappy socks as gifts. Wouldn’t recommend these socks to anyone!Jody Kelly"
PupSocks,2021-01-05T19:51:07Z,5,The socks were a hit! They were a little too big for my gift recipient but the quality outstood that issue. The socks are warm and look very cute. I submitted just a plain photo of the cat for this pair and they edited it very well! I was very impressed and would recommend this website.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T19:50:21Z,5,Wonderful! I will order again!
PupSocks,2021-01-05T19:49:03Z,1,"Ordered Nov 7, 2020 for Christmas presents,  still have not received.I hope they are atleast nice when they arrive."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T19:43:20Z,5,this socks turned out ignant on foenem
PupSocks,2021-01-05T19:42:59Z,1,Yuck. Wish I could get my money back. These socks are made out of some thick very elastic material. They are not comfortable or breathable. Remind me of compression socks I had to wear when I was pregnant. Also have big square toe that is baggy. Only thing I like is my dogs face.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T19:39:10Z,1,"Pup Socks says they produce things fast, because orders are in production in less than one day (this is why they don't allow cancelations.) My order sat in production for nine days with no progress.  With Christmas fast approaching, I tried to get a status update or cancel. My email was answered by an autoresponder that said I’d get a personal response in three days.  It never came. I emailed again. No response at all. Ever. Four attempts to get an update were all met with silence.My credit card charge showed a phone number. I called it.  That went to some completely different type of business. There was no way to speak to anyone. I had to buy something else to replace my PupSocks gift for Christmas.My order finally arrived late.  Half of it was missing, never shipped. In the end, I got an autoresponder email from the CEO blaming the post office for his company’s problems. The post office isn’t the one that doesn’t produce orders, doesn’t answer emails, and ships half the product. That didn't stop the CEO from blaming the post office for his failure to complete my order, answer an email, or provide any customer service.  He accepted no blame.  There’s just no integrity here, no customer focus. A perfect example of how NOT to do business.While I waited to get a status update on my order, I received two different emails encouraging me to place an additional order, guaranteeing delivery in time for Christmas.  Unable to keep up with their workload, they were still trying to gain new business before fulfilling existing commitments. That’s unethical.I won’t do business with this company again"
PupSocks,2021-01-05T19:36:10Z,1,Awful customer service.  I will never purchase from pupsocks again.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T19:34:59Z,5,"I bought these socks for my hubby as a Christmas present. We had to say goodbye to our pup almost 6 years ago and we obviously still miss her, my husband especially. He almost cried when he saw her face. I was beyond happy with how they turned out. I highly recommend these as a sweet reminder of a fur baby gone over the Rainbow Bridge, as a fun gift or just some cool funky socks for yourself!"
PupSocks,2021-01-05T19:34:15Z,5,"I bought pup socks for my son for Christmas! He absolutely loves them!!! I accidentally ordered the wrong color, emailed pupsocks quickly after placing the order and they were able to change the color for me so accommodating!! Will definitely be back."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T19:31:07Z,5,Great gift. Photo came out very well.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T19:26:04Z,1,I don't know why I received an invitation to review. I ordered the item for a Christmas gift and it never arrived.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T19:25:26Z,1,Ordered socks for my mother for Christmas on Nov 24th. It is now Jan 5th and I still haven't received them. I understand shipping is behind right now but when I emailed customer service to inquire about my order they didn't even respond. Will not buy from this company again. I do not mind waiting but the fact that I didn't even get a response was pretty unprofessional.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T19:25:04Z,1,Items never arrived
PupSocks,2021-01-05T19:20:17Z,5,The colors are bright. Print quality is great and what is better than seeing your beloved fur baby on socks? I laughed for a solid 5 minutes when I opened the package. Worth it.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T19:18:53Z,1,"I don't like to leave negative feedback but unfortunately, I received a pair of socks with someone else's dog on them. I emailed the company asking what to do as far as getting it resolved. I received an automatic reply from the CEO indicating that they were swamped with 1000's of emails due to the USPS delays. I did receive the socks on time but they were the wrong socks. I am still waiting to get a response from PupSocks on how to rectify the order."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T19:18:32Z,3,"Ordered before Thanksgiving and the socks were in “production” for three weeks. Then with our postal service, they showed up well after Christmas. I had two images printed on the socks. The images were off center and the edge of one dog’s ear ran off the edge of the sock."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T19:18:25Z,2,"My experience in ordering and receiving the socks was fine but the socks themselves are not good quality -- it's hard to tell from the photos but the material is strange -- it's not knit and it's not cotton, it's like the material has a plastic weave through it. Also, despite ordering different sizes for my two kids, they arrived one-size-fits-all size and have a squareness to the foot (no contour, not snug). So my boys don't wear them, they're way too big and not at all comfortable for them. This is totally a novelty item. If that's what you're looking for, great. But if you're looking to actually wear the socks, I doubt you'll be satisfied. I wasn't."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T19:16:46Z,5,Great quality! My son loves it!
PupSocks,2021-01-05T19:16:32Z,5,Socks turned out perfect! Great Christmas surprise
PupSocks,2021-01-05T19:15:55Z,4,I did  not know what the socks would like prior to receiving them. I wish I could've gotten a preview to approve first.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T19:14:45Z,2,"I was really disappointed in my purchase. The artists did a great job cropping my dog’s face and the iPhone picture I used looked clear! However, the colors on the website are NOT accurate compared to the color that arrived and the sizing was way off. I chose the royal purple color and the socks that came in were almost pink. I also bought according to their sizing guide and the socks are so tight that they are uncomfortable to wear. It literally hurts to bend my foot upward and the socks makes marks on my legs because they are so tight. They are completely unwearable. The fit is also off around the toes. These socks LOOK great if you don’t care about the color and don’t care to actually wear them. I would not buy again."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T19:14:42Z,1,"I placed 2 orders Nov 26th/2020 and I am still waiting for them to arrive. I have tried multiple times to get some sort of information about delivery date but no response. This is horrible service. If I ran my business this way, I would surely go out of business. Get it together PupSocks!!!"
PupSocks,2021-01-05T19:13:13Z,1,Package never arrived and usps still has marked in transit.   So I couldn’t possibly give a good review on a Christmas gift that never showed up And is two weeks overdue and most likely lost in the mail.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T19:13:00Z,5,I ordered a blanket with our dog's pic. It turned out great and it was shipped fast. I bought two as gifts for my daughters and they loved them. Great quality.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T19:07:58Z,4,Socks are well represented in the marketing materials.  I got a pic of the grandkid's dog and cat and had one made for each.  Good job with photos.  The fit seemed a little off but the kids still LOVED them.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T19:06:38Z,4,I ordered the blanket and socks combo for my 18 year old daughter for Christmas with our two dogs' faces on each item. This company did a wonderful job with the blanket and socks and my daughter absolutely loved them!  The quality was much better than I was expecting.  My only complaint is the delay in the order completion and shipping.  I placed my order just before Thanksgiving and did not receive the order until the day after Christmas.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T19:05:41Z,4,"Cropping and printing was great and socks came pretty fast. They ran big, though, and are a little bit of a weird shiny material. Be mindful of the lighting of the picture you send, you might want to crop it on your own just to see if the lighting is uneven as it was for me. Overall a fun gift though!"
PupSocks,2021-01-05T19:02:06Z,1,Really weird plastic-like material for socks. My gf refuses to wear them. Would not buy again
PupSocks,2021-01-05T19:02:02Z,5,Great socks!
PupSocks,2021-01-05T18:58:50Z,2,I still don’t have my order from December 7th.  They really made her face too skinny from the image I received.  I wouldn’t order again.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T18:58:48Z,2,Was promised it would arrive before Christmas and it has not even left place of origin. Very disappointed will not order again. Will tell my friends to avoid this company for this type of thing.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T18:56:20Z,1,"These socks arrived and the photo was indistinguishable because a glare that was not apparent in the photo I submitted. Now my daughter has a pair of socks that she doesn’t even find that comfortable, no elasticity. We won’t ever use this services again and I recommend no one else does either. I also submitted a complaint where the response was not fitting to the complaint!"
PupSocks,2021-01-05T18:55:30Z,1,"Well --- I CAN'T REVIEW my product, BECAUSE I STILL HAVEN'T RECEIVED MY ORDER.  Placed on December 8th?!?!?!?!  Today is JANUARY 5th.  I'm so aggravated and mad, as this was a Christmas gift.  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY --- people online have also reported getting the wrong items!  I HOPE, AFTER WAITING 4+ WEEKS, vs the promised 8 - 10 days, that this isn't the case. TOO BAD I CAN'T GET MY SHIPPING & HANDLING FEES BACK, EITHER.  No customer support response.  Out of six times reaching out, I only have 3 automated replies.  CANNOT REACH A HUMAN WHATSOEVER."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T18:54:53Z,1,"I ordered in November and it's now January 5 and still haven't received anything. PupSocks uses a shipping company (Asendia) that is somehow much slower than the US postal system?! According to their tracking, my order has been stuck in Miami since December 18. I know it is going to Canada, but I have family in the USA that have sent parcels to me *in December* by USPS that arrived before Christmas! Also, Asendia does not respond to any requests and don't seem to have customer service. Maybe I will upgrade this rating when I get my package, but who knows how many more weeks that will take. Terrible experience so far."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T18:53:28Z,1,I still have not received my order placed in early December. ORDER NO. 2512064
PupSocks,2021-01-05T18:53:16Z,1,"These are made of a strange material and oddly designed. They fit no feet, whether child or adult. VERY disappointed. Cats faces are fine, but didn't turn out as cute as expected. A little too tightly cropped."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T18:52:29Z,1,Still have not received the pair I bought for my wife for Christmas. Ordered in November.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T18:51:28Z,1,Company lied when they said they shipped product. Took over a month to get. They tried to blame it on usps and covid.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T18:47:50Z,1,I placed an order on December 8 and still have not received my order. It was intended be a present for Christmas and I was not expecting it to take this long. Very disappointed!
PupSocks,2021-01-05T18:43:45Z,5,Amazing! Such cute socks that I was excited to give them as a gift for my boyfriend for Christmas!
PupSocks,2021-01-05T18:43:43Z,1,"I placed my order on December 2, 2020. I was sent my order number and tracking number on December 7. The package never left Atlanta. I emailed customer service and received a discount. I don’t want a discount, I want a refund. This was a Christmas gift. I understand COVID delays however I ordered all my gifts online and this is the only one that did not show up. I need this refunded as quickly as the money was deducted from my account."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T18:43:28Z,1,"I was worried about the quality of the design going into the purchase, but I guess I at least assumed the socks would be wearable. I was wrong. What arrived was a tube shaped piece of cheap fabric that is better suited for a baseball bat than a foot."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T18:42:41Z,1,I ordered a pair of socks over a month ahead of Christmas and did not get them until after. Never received tracking info until it was a late notice. Awful customer service!
PupSocks,2021-01-05T18:41:48Z,5,The socks and blanket I ordered for my daughter were perfect! The order was delayed and communication between Pupsocks and myself was excellent. The order made it to her before Christmas. I was thankful for the correspondence and was able to let her know it might be later than Christmas. What a wonderful surprise when she got them on Christmas Eve. Thanks so much for helping to put a smile on her face.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T18:37:50Z,5,My daughter loved the socks with her dear departed kitty on them ❤️
PupSocks,2021-01-05T18:37:28Z,3,They came after Christmas and after I drove to Texas.  They were Christmas present.  Now I have to pay for shipping g again to get them to individuals.  I wish they would have showed a pick of them first.  The one cat head they missed all the gray hair around the face.  It would have been nice to be able to view the proof.More than likely won’t buy from them again.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T18:36:56Z,4,"Good quality product.  Would give five stars but I subtract one for the overly long production and ship time.  I ordered in late November for Xmas but it didn't make it here until after New Years day.  Other than that, no complaints."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T18:35:54Z,4,"Liked my product, received someone else’s order in addition to mine. Tried to reach the company and have not heard back in more than a week."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T18:32:46Z,1,Still haven’t received my order
PupSocks,2021-01-05T18:30:15Z,1,I never received my delivery !
PupSocks,2021-01-05T18:29:54Z,5,"Socks are as advertised.  This was a perfect stocking-stuffer for my wife, who is almost too much of a cat person."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T18:27:27Z,5,The socks are awesome and had great detail!!!
PupSocks,2021-01-05T18:25:38Z,1,"Completely disappointed!The pup socks delivery was delayed for a week after Christmas.The quality of the socks themselves are thin fabric and uncomfortable, so much so that my teenage daughters did not even want to put them on."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T18:25:17Z,1,"I ordered socks on December 8. As of today, January 5, they still have not arrived. Very disappointing. Would not recommend"
PupSocks,2021-01-05T18:23:19Z,5,"Despite COVID-19 and shipping to Canada, I received the cutest socks in good time from Pupsocks.  Thank you!"
PupSocks,2021-01-05T18:22:58Z,1,"My joy in receiving the socks immediately turned to dismay when I saw how poor the quality of the actual socks are. And, oh by the way, the socks are not made in the USA! Their website is incredibly misleading...”printed in the USA”, “..we’re not a mysterious overseas internet company” all pointing to being a US based company AND product. But it’s not until you receive the socks that you can see that they are actually made in China, even if the designs on them are printed in the USA. PupSocks should be ashamed of themselves for misleading customers who want to buy Made in America.Also, I placed two orders on 12/6. The first shipped 12/11 and finally arrived on 1/4. The other shipped on 12/19 and has yet to arrive. Customer service was awful - taking over a week to get back to me (with a less than helpful update mind you) when I was told I’d hear back within 3 days. I’m almost glad these didn’t arrive on time because they were meant to be holiday presents. Given what I now know, I’m actually glad they didn’t arrive in time to be given as presents because I’d be embarrassed at giving such over-priced, low quality gifts. I wonder how helpful customer service will be in accepting returns..."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T18:22:56Z,1,Gift arrived today and was ordered in November.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T18:16:19Z,1,The photo of our dog on the socks was pretty good - somewhat dim/light around the edges - but OK. However the quality of these socks is terrible. Terrible. Not soft. Too long - even for an adult. And just icky. Would not ever order again or recommend.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T18:14:44Z,4,I bought these socks for my boys 8 & 12 for Christmas with our family dogs face on them and they were so excited.  I got the socks per their age but they still were a bit big on them but they still loved them.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T18:14:28Z,1,I ordered two Christmas gifts early in November and as of January 5th they both have yet to arrive.  Two days before Christmas they gave me a sheet to print out to give in place of the gift.  I have spent way too much money on this company and I will never order from them again.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T18:14:09Z,3,"The socks were cute, but the size ran small. They also did not arrive in time for Christmas. So now I’m forced to pay shipping to get them to their intended person. I realize not totally your fault."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T18:13:18Z,1,"The socks look good, but the quality is really bad. The size is even too big for a 10. A pair of socks like this shouldn’t cost $30. Way too overpriced."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T18:12:25Z,5,Very satisfied with product/process
PupSocks,2021-01-05T18:12:14Z,5,Love my cat blanket! Makes me feel like I’mcuddling with my two deceased cats with oversized heads!
PupSocks,2021-01-05T18:11:30Z,1,"The printing is nice, but calling them socks is a stretch. They are tubes of fabric that’t stretch or bend, so they can’t even be worn.  They’re a good gimmick, poor sock."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T18:11:05Z,3,"I bought two pairs of socks - one for each of my daughters aged 17 and 8. They LOVED the designs and photos of their pets on the socks. However, they were very difficult to get on and very tight over the top of the foot/instep. Even after washing, there was not a lot of ""give"" where the sock/foot bends near the ankle and both found the socks uncomfortable to wear. Unfortunately, that means the girls will not wear them...though the did hang them up on the wall because they were so cute."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T18:10:56Z,5,Great idea for the pet lover on your list.  Chose the socks with 2 pictures and they were absolutely loved!  Great gift anytime.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T18:10:16Z,5,My wife loved the socks.!
PupSocks,2021-01-05T18:09:22Z,5,Kids loved them!!!
PupSocks,2021-01-05T18:09:19Z,5,amazing quality! they are so fun to give as gifts!
PupSocks,2021-01-05T18:08:56Z,1,If there was an option for zero stars that’s what I would give your company.  I ordered a mask with my dog on 12/7.  The mask came on 12/24 with the wrong dog on it.  I have emailed  your customer service twice and received no response.  Pup socks is absolutely one of the worst companies I’ve ever ordered from.  Probably should have checked better business bureau before ordering.  I see you have several hundred complaints.  Speaks volumes.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T18:07:53Z,1,Ordered December 8th. Received several days after Christmas. No calls or timely response back from the no “customer service”dept. Don’t promise or “guarantee by Christmas delivery” if you can’t deliver. Don’t use shipping delays as an excuse. Covid has been around for months and we’ve all experienced the delivery delays but that’s been handled by most other companies. Yours was the ONLY item not received by Christmas and I did every gift online this year spending over $4K so you simply dropped the ball.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T18:06:58Z,1,I placed an order on December 8th in hopes to get the socks by Christmas for my mom. I received the order in early January. I highly recommend you people get your production time in order. You said 8-10 business days and I received the order over 20 days later. I will not be purchasing from you again. I love the idea of pup socks but the customer service and delivery time was bad enough for me to not recommend to anyone who doesn’t want to wait a month for their package
PupSocks,2021-01-05T18:06:20Z,1,"Funny that I’m being asked to review a product I still haven’t received! I ordered these on December 9th and still haven’t received them. I’ve also emailed inquiring about when I’m receiving them and a refund, no response. Buyer beware!"
PupSocks,2021-01-05T18:05:42Z,3,"Ordered WAY early. Was told the gift had plenty of time to make it by Christmas. It was ordered first week of December so I didn’t imagine it would not make it. Not only did it miss Christmas entirely but we didn’t even get a response to let us know the only gift i purchased for someone was not going to make it. Then I had to email them after Christmas and they sent an automated response blaming the post office delays etc. No live response. I could not believe they blamed the postal service! I buy from Japan and not one of their packages took longer than 3-4 days to reach us so pretty lousy management of the number of orders they took in to fulfill, poor communication and then total disregard for missing Christmas gifts that were purchased. So no, would not recommend their company or service unfortunately. Too bad because the concept is cute."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T18:05:36Z,1,"Been over a month still haven’t received my order, tried contacting customer service, they just send an automatic reply"
PupSocks,2021-01-05T18:05:00Z,4,"Five stars for the socks; they turned out great! However, it took a very long time to receive them, over a month from the order date. I know this is due to both increased sales volume and increased shipping volume during the holidays, but it was disappointing because these were a gift for Christmas. I thought I had ordered them well enough ahead to account for the increased holiday traffic. They were ordered thanksgiving weekend but my nephew didn’t receive them until January 5th."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T18:04:41Z,2,"Ok quality socks.  Took 3+ weeks to get, even though I was told would have prior to Christmas they showed up after the fact.   Had to go buy a quick present so the person I bought them for would have something to open on Christmas Day."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T18:04:06Z,1,"Took just over 3 weeks to get my order, missed Christmas day and when it arrived it had a picture of a random dog, not ours. I've attempted contact to resolve with several methods and haven't gotten a response. Avoid!!!"
PupSocks,2021-01-05T18:03:37Z,4,"The socks were cool. I told my husband the cat ordered them himself and I think he believed me. Shipping took a while, but they did finally arrive. Next time there's a sale, I am going to have to the dog order a pair for my son."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T18:03:11Z,1,I did not received my order yet.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T18:02:07Z,2,"I would like to say that I placed an order for three blankets on December 9 anticipating them to be delivered for Christmas. Only one arrived and it arrived on the 26th. The other two have yet to arrive as of today January 5.The quality of the one blanket that arrived was great. I’m very happy with it. I wouldn’t be giving this poor review if I received a complete order. It’s also been very difficult to get in touch with anybody in customer service whether it be emailing, instant messaging, or attempting a phone call. The phone number that is listed on the American Express transaction goes unanswered by a live human.I understand we have a lot of unusual activity going on with Covid. That’s completely understandable. However, having a correct contact phone number and getting a response back in a reasonable amount of time is critical and should be provided.I am hoping I get my other two blanket orders soon."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T18:02:04Z,1,I am waiting my package since 24th november and nobody knows where is it or whats going on. All the information I can find is covid problems.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T18:01:19Z,1,I still haven't received them.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T18:00:28Z,1,"Product never received - I will never purchase this product again. I ordered two set of socks on the 23rd of November and have still not received the product. They did send me a ""mockup"" of what they might look like should I ever receive the product, however I only received a mockup of one set of socks. Despite requesting an update on the second set, and a number of enquiries of where my orders actually are I have not received any response or update on shipping. I am now going to put my energy into requesting a refund and alerting others to the incompetence of their order handing process."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T18:00:15Z,1,"Ordered a medium pair. Quality was great, but the socks I received looked like they were XL. Did not fit the intended recipient. Closer to a Christmas stocking it was so large."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T17:59:10Z,5,The quality of print and customer service were great. Their commitment to customer satisfaction was evident by the email they sent out in mid-December with a mock-up of the order that could be printed out and given to the recipient while they waited for the order to arrive. They could have thrown their hands up and claimed not to be able to help but they didn't. They made sure we had something tangible to give our loved ones and I think that says a lot.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T17:58:53Z,1,"I’ve now written 5 times asking for a refund. The only response I’ve received is to the first email and it was a canned reply blaming the post office for the delay I was experiencing. My email wasn’t about a delay. The picture on the socks could be a giraffe, could be a t-Rex, could be the picture I submitted, cannot tell because it is so blurry and low quality. The socks are not socks at all, just a tube of extremely cheap material with a black section sewn in sort of close to where the heel should be. I’m so disgusted with this product but even more disgusted with their choosing to ignore my emails. This company steals your money while they hide behind the facade of we care about and donate to animals. Don’t fall for it! Take your $30, buy some good socks, frame a picture of your pet and donate a few bucks to a shelter directly and leave these thieves out of the equation."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T17:58:39Z,2,"I ordered socks, and I love the concept. The graphic quality of the images appears to have transferred well to the fabric. However, the socks are unwearable - the cut of the sock is like a straight tube and is not made to conform to the shape of the foot. The fabric is constricted along the top of the foot at the ankle and bunches up here as a result. There is no pocket where the heel would naturally sit. There is also no taper at the toe end - instead, there is a straight blunt-cut seam which does not follow the natural taper of human toes. Consequently the fabric bunches up at the toes if you try to wear them inside of shoes. I bought two of these as gifts but sadly they will never be used. I suggest that you search for a better fitting sock."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T17:58:35Z,1,"The socks literally felt like two pieces of gross fabric put together. They were not comfortable, cute, or funny. Honestly a really disappointing experience. I reached out to the company and they still have no responded. I would like my money back."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T17:58:33Z,5,Excellent service. Excellent product. The photo of the dog was a crazy-good reproduction onto the socks. Recommend 5*
PupSocks,2021-01-05T17:57:47Z,1,Never received my package. Ordered in November
PupSocks,2021-01-05T17:57:39Z,2,Picture was good but the material used for the socks wasn’t what I expected.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T17:56:55Z,5,These socks are so cute!  The prints came out perfectly and were very clear.  Everyone loves them.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T17:55:02Z,2,"paid for 3 dog faces, got proof of 3 separate pictures submitted, got two dogs only.  Sounds like no big deal until its a Christmas present for someone w/ three dogs that now has socks w/ two of them only.  That and $30 for a pair of socks...underwhelmed.  Plus not one response from Pupsocks in trying to get corrected socks in led me to this review."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T17:54:09Z,1,"Unfortunately, 4-5 items I ordered were created incorrectly.  I have sent two emails to their customer service and received the same generic auto-reply email response.  What a rip-off!!"
PupSocks,2021-01-05T17:52:48Z,5,These socks came out better than I expected. Very bright colors and the photo image was very clear of the two cats' faces. Material was sturdy and comfortable. My son loves them!
PupSocks,2021-01-05T17:52:33Z,1,I never received my order and have sent multiple emails with no response. Only automated responses
PupSocks,2021-01-05T17:52:24Z,1,"Promised my order before Christmas, 14 business days later it was still not delivered.  They blame USPS on the website and generic email response.  Now, 13 days later still no response from customer service via email.  Just an auto reply blaming USPS.  Will never order again."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T17:51:55Z,5,I had ordered Pupsocks early in December and even though I did not receive my socks when I had hoped...I have to give a great shout out for their response to me when I had inquired the status of my socks.  Response is what customer service is all about and gives me solid confidence in ordering from them again!Service expectations do not always go as planned especially in today's world. It is all in how fast the response is that makes the difference in experience!Thank you PupSocks...You are the best and I appreciate you!
PupSocks,2021-01-05T17:51:30Z,2,One of the socks came with the two cats. The other did not. Paid a lot for two cats on two pairs of socks...
PupSocks,2021-01-05T17:51:00Z,1,"Ordered my socks 6 weeks ago, have not received, emails following up have not been replied, have been charged."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T17:50:47Z,3,The product was great but it took 4 weeks for delivery. I feel that is unacceptable.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T17:50:23Z,1,"Product is okay but customer service is utterly atrocious. No one responds, instead you get the most annoying robotic email responses. The CEO doesn’t even respond to messages. A company that does not care about their customers and does not keep their promises."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T17:46:33Z,1,"I ordered in Late November for a gift for Christmas, and the items I ordered didn't arrive until early January"
PupSocks,2021-01-05T17:46:01Z,3,"Socks are ok. Disappointed in quality of the cropping of the photo. All pupsocks advertisements show the pet’s face nicely contoured around the head, face, jaw. The image on my socks was just a generic circle with only the ears contoured, which doesn’t have the same visual impact as the advertised images."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T17:43:31Z,1,I sent two pics with specific instructions (and paid for) two different dogs to be on the socks. Instead I received socks with the same dog pictured twice. It was a Christmas gift for my son and I was very disappointed.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T17:43:04Z,3,"I ordered a blanket on 12/6 (for a Christmas present). When I received my order confirmation it stated that I would receive my order in 8-10 business days. When I had not received any communication from you I reached out on 12/19 to inquire about my order. I received an automated response to my message stating that USPS had left you in the dark as to where my package was and that I needed to be understanding of the situation. I probably could have been understanding if that would have been the issue, but it was not. The blanket had not even left your facility yet. In the meantime I am receiving marketing emails from your company stating that you can still get your product to customers by Christmas.  Whaaat???  I finally received an email stating that a shipping label had been created on 12/21. The blanket arrived yesterday 1/4 in an opened sack. Merry Christmas! Needless to say this was not a pleasant experience and probably my last.  I understand you may have had production issues, but be honest."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T17:41:21Z,5,Perfect gift! So cute! Great quality!
PupSocks,2021-01-05T17:40:44Z,4,"Shipping was a bit slow but it was during Pandemic Christmastime. When the blanket arrived, it was of high quality and super soft. Will definitely get something in the future."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T17:38:46Z,5,"Ordered for our daughter as she prepares to move away from home. Our dog has been with her for almost 13 years, so she will miss him tremendously (he will stay with mom and dad.)This is a great little something that she can take to keep him nearby, when she is far away, that won't take a lot of space or work for her.Con - it took just about a month to receive the order, including 3 weeks after the socks were produced. This is obviously a symptom of USPS challenges - not Pupsocks - but it was disappointing that these arrived almost 2 weeks after Christmas. Make sure you order with PLENTY of time."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T17:38:26Z,5,"Love love love the socks, so cute and great quality!"
PupSocks,2021-01-05T17:38:10Z,5,The socks turned out awesome! My wife loved them as a Christmas present.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T17:38:04Z,1,"I ordered a pair of socks on 23 November for a Christmas present, and was told ""You can expect to receive your order in 8 - 10 business days"". Socks weren't shipped until 19 December (20 business days later), it's now 5 January and they still haven't arrived.I understand Christmas is a busy time for both orders and shipping, but they gave zero warning of delays back in November, and even still say ""Lightning Fast Shipping"" on the site. Just be upfront and honest about how long it will take to ship."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T17:36:38Z,1,Did not meet shipping commitments would not recommend. Socks are very scratchy
PupSocks,2021-01-05T17:36:21Z,5,The perfect gift!
PupSocks,2021-01-05T17:36:16Z,1,I ordered my socks and have yet to receive them. It’s been 2 months!
PupSocks,2021-01-05T17:35:08Z,3,The print on the socks is great. I expected different material perhaps or a more form fitting sock.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T17:34:51Z,1,"If I could give 0 stars, I would. I ordered socks at the end of November. When I received the socks on 12/7, they were not the socks I ordered. After multiple attempts to contact customer service and getting no response, I looked at other reviews with the same issues as me and then I reported the case to the Better Business Bureau, which has red-flagged this company. Only after I filed a complaint with the BBB did I receive a response from Pup Socks. They chose to re-print my order. The item was marked shipped on 12/21 with a promise to have it by Christmas. Christmas came and went with the item still in pre-shipment (label created only and not taken to USPS). I had to open another complaint with the BBB on 12/29. Finally, on 12/30, my package was taken to the local USPS for shipment and I received it today 1/5. Honestly, for all the hassle and the cost, the quality was not worth it. The photo and color are fine but the material of the socks is cheap, thin, and does not appeal to me. They are a gift for my son so I’m sure he won’t care about the sub-par material, he will just be happy to have the only thing he asked for Christmas to finally be here. I will not be making future purchases."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T17:33:32Z,1,"I ordered a pair of socks in November for a Christmas present and they arrived in January and the tracking never updated. Not only did they not arrive for Xmas but when they did arrive the quality of the socks are more closer to plastic than actual socks, quite glad they didn’t arrive in time so I can through them away instead of gift them."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T17:33:25Z,5,Fast ship from USA not like others out there very happy
PupSocks,2021-01-05T17:30:09Z,3,"I purchased matching socks for my sister and brother-in-law for Christmas with pictures of both of their dogs. The team did a great job cropping the photos so they look superb! However, the quality is lacking. They have square toes that don’t fit right. So much so, the socks won’t be worn. They were a comical gift that was a hit, but unfortunately they will stay in a drawer. Pretty unfortunate for the price, but it makes me feel better knowing my purchase fed dogs."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T17:29:50Z,1,I asked for the glare to be taken out the eyes of the dogs and it was not. The socks are too big to the intented receiver. The shipping experience was awful.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T17:29:36Z,3,SHIPPING TOOK TOO LONG
PupSocks,2021-01-05T17:29:30Z,1,Have you shipped the products?I 'ven't received socks yet despite ordering them 6 weeks ago :(
PupSocks,2021-01-05T17:29:14Z,5,The socks turned out great!
PupSocks,2021-01-05T17:28:24Z,1,Still not received my order
PupSocks,2021-01-05T17:28:24Z,1,I placed an order on early December and I haven't received it yet. This was the first and last time.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T17:28:00Z,5,My girlfriend loves the pup socks! Great Christmas gift!
PupSocks,2021-01-05T17:22:28Z,1,Socks are not comfortable and don't fit well at all. The picture quality of my dog was not at all what I expected and didn't look like her at all. It turned more cartoonish than anything. Do not recommend.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T17:20:54Z,1,Item was ordered over four weeks ago (Dec 8) as a Christmas gift. Still has not arrived. Very dissatisfied. Will never order from this site again.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T17:19:38Z,5,"Excellent company, excellent products.  They care about their customers, not just about making money.  Will order from them again."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T17:19:28Z,1,Ordered an item over 2 months ago as an Xmas gift still haven’t received. B.S SCAM if you ask me.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T17:18:26Z,1,6 weeks to receive order. Unaceptable.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T17:17:56Z,3,Decent product. I liked the novelty of the product.  But took over a month to process and ship.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T17:17:49Z,5,Excellent Product and Company
PupSocks,2021-01-05T17:17:30Z,5,These were amazing quality and a huge hit as a Secret Santa gift. Can't recommend enough!
PupSocks,2021-01-05T17:16:40Z,5,Picture were cropped beautifully and the quality of print was awesome! Will be ordering again!
PupSocks,2021-01-05T17:16:15Z,3,The Socks look great but ordered on Dec 9 and didn’t receive until after Christmas
PupSocks,2021-01-05T17:15:34Z,1,Still not delivered
PupSocks,2021-01-05T17:10:57Z,4,I love the socks we got for husbands Christmas present. Our labs face was really clear in the printing. My only complaint would be shipping but under the circumstances shipping everywhere is a mess. As a company definitely a thumbs up. Would order from pup socks again.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T17:09:34Z,1,"I had (and continue to have) the worst experience with pup socks. I ordered a Christmas present in November for a Christmas gift and the gift never arrived. As I’ve tried to contact pupsocks, I rarely got response and when I did (only via email... there is no phone number), they blamed USPS and refused to refund my purchase. They only offered a store credit minus $9 for the custom order. The customer service is terrible and their business ethic is awful. I will not recommend them to anyone and will never purchase from them again.  I’ve filed a claim with my bank. This continues to take tons of time and frustration. Don’t order from this company. I never write bad reviews. I love supporting small businesses, but I fear others will have the same experience I had and wish I would have known."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T17:08:37Z,1,"I was so excited about this Christmas gift for my family after reading such great reviews. Unfortunately, the socks were of terrible quality. They don't have a heel built into them; this is a simple plastic-y tube sock that has a black triangle where the heel is supposed to go, which then makes the fabric bunch up on the front of the foot as the pattern is not really meant as a real sock. The tube is unshaped, so the toes are loose and the tube is SO. TIGHT around the ankle and calf. Note: my five family members (three older teens and an adult) are all very tall and have a slim build, so size would not have been an issue. I ordered the correct foot size for each person. The very TIGHT fit makes these unbearable to wear on slender calves. And even if they DID want to wear them, the photo of the pup's face becomes so stretched out and distorted on the ankle and calf that it ruins the desired effect. I spent $125 on socks that were supposed to be the best and most sentimental gift they received this year, only to throw them in the garbage. I have four disappointed kids. :( Really great idea, very poor execution. I'm sorry pupsocks, but this one missed the mark. Maybe the blankets are better?"
PupSocks,2021-01-05T17:07:52Z,5,5 StarsThese turned out amazing and were the perfect gift for my dog loving friend.  Cannot recommend enough!
PupSocks,2021-01-05T17:07:03Z,5,I ordered two pairs of socks for my husband for Christmas. I received the order in the time frame quoted. The photos were edited and displayed in very good quality. I will be back to order more.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T17:06:28Z,5,"This is the second time I have ordered from PupSocks and both times I had a great experience. Ordering is extremely simple and there is a lot of communication after the purchase is made.  For Christmas 2020, PupSocks went out of their way to notify of any delays (in delivery) and even sent out an order mockup to share in case they did not arrive on time.  I received my order on Christmas Eve and was thrilled!  My son and daughter-in-law loved their blanket and socks.  I will continue to order items from PupSocks!  Thanks for everything!"
PupSocks,2021-01-05T17:05:43Z,1,Ordered for Christmas present....still haven't seen my order. ):
PupSocks,2021-01-05T17:03:16Z,1,Order 2458744 missing!I am still missing my order 2458744. I received the one : 2409921 but still missed the other one. SO no gift for 2 person on Xmas! :-(Can you confirm when you'll send me the order 2458744 please?Thanks a lot!
PupSocks,2021-01-05T17:01:38Z,1,"I did not receive my socks although I did receive a shipping notification. When I emailed to ask where they were, I received an email bounce back. Definitely unhappy as I purchased them as a Christmas gift in early November and never received them. Do not recommend."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T16:58:35Z,1,Haven’t even received my order yet. It’s been months.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T16:58:20Z,1,I have not received my order. It was placed in November
PupSocks,2021-01-05T16:56:49Z,3,"The socks are so cute with the pictures of our pets on them.  However, the socks don't fit very well (very tight in the calf and loose in the foot) and are very uncomfortable to wear.  We will be keeping them as a gift to look at and not to actually use."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T16:55:15Z,5,Awesome socks!! Great gift!!
PupSocks,2021-01-05T16:53:08Z,5,Socks and pics on them are great.  My wife really like getting them as an Xmas gift.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T16:53:00Z,3,"While the socks are really cute, they are not practical to wear.  Really bunch up at the front of my ankle."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T16:52:44Z,1,They will say they are shipped and they aren't.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T16:46:49Z,1,I ordered 3 pair of socks on 11/24/20 and it is 1/6/21 and have not received items. When I tracked the package it says the label was created on December 5 but the post office has not received the product. I will never order from this company again.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T16:46:13Z,1,I ordered socks over a month ago and still have not received my order. I’ve tried reaching out but have not heard back from anyone
PupSocks,2021-01-05T16:45:25Z,4,"I asked for one picture to be kept upside down (the cat's head was upside down on the couch) and it was turned right side up, unfortunately. Also, they are ""pup"" socks, seems to only be options for dog bones and paws, even with pics of cats. Otherwise they look and fell great!"
PupSocks,2021-01-05T16:40:12Z,1,Placed the order 7 weeks ago and it shows it's still in production. Disappointed that it takes 2 months to get it. So much for a surprise gift
PupSocks,2021-01-05T16:36:11Z,5,My daughter loves her socks and blanket with her puppies picture.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T16:33:21Z,3,The quality is fine. They run very big. I got the youth size for my 5 year old and my US women’s size 11 could probably fit. There’s also a weird seam on them that runs the whole length of the sock. The novelty is cute and well done but not worth the $50 I spent for 2 pairs.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T16:31:49Z,3,Giving a three star average review because I placed two orders and one went very smoothly and I received the set of socks in a timely manner and they looked great. The other order I placed was lost in the mail and I couldn’t reach anyone from Pupsocks to track it or find out what the next steps were. I had to elevate the matter to PayPal until someone reached out to me. Perhaps ordering around Christmas time is not the best as they get overwhelmed with orders and shipments.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T16:30:59Z,3,"Everything about the product itself is good -- very happy with what I received.Unfortunately, the delivery process was a bit of a mess. The main issue is that a label was created for the product, but it wasn't actually dropped off with USPS for almost ten days. This (plus the manufacturing time + the understandable holiday rush for USPS) meant that my order took almost a month to get to its recipient. More problematic than the timeline was the poor responsiveness from customer service. I sent two emails through their email and website reporting platforms, without any response. I eventually got someone through the on-site chat. All in all, I like the product, but would go to a competitor if given the option given the poor customer experience."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T16:29:16Z,3,"I ordered a blanket and the picture that I sent came out way darker than I thought it would. It was a cute surprise though, and the blanket could be a little thicker."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T16:29:14Z,3,Too slippery to wear on hardwood! My boyfriend slipped and fell right after trying them on. He now refuses to wear them. It's a shame because the picture of his cat turned out great!
PupSocks,2021-01-05T16:28:05Z,1,"I still have not received my pup socks order that was a Christmas present for my son. I ordered November 14th. If you are not able to get things out for Christmas just be truthful! Covid or not, 6weeks should be ample time or chose another method of shipping!Very disappointed customer"
PupSocks,2021-01-05T16:27:52Z,5,"My wife purchased a pair of socks from PupSocks for me for my birthday, with pictures of my favorite dog who had passed away on them. That was probably one of the best gifts I have received in a long time!"
PupSocks,2021-01-05T16:27:12Z,1,"I placed an order on 11/24/20 and have yet to receive a notification of a tracking number.  Every time I check the status it says ""in production"" as it has since the day I ordered it.  I have sent at least 3 emails and keep being told that it's either in production or they blame it on the post office.  I have filed a claim with PayPal in the hopes that I can get my money back.  There is a group on Facebook for people with complaints about Pupsocks and there are a lot."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T16:24:53Z,4,"She loved all of it! Such a great job on the pics! I only wish it had been sent out sooner, but I understand the holidays are busy."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T16:24:34Z,3,I ordered three pairs of socks. Two came out great and as expected. The third did not come out with the pet I requested. Maybe my fault for sending a picture of two cats but I did include a note on which cat to focus on. I’d recommend but be careful with the pictures you send.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T16:24:19Z,1,"I placed my order on November 23, 2020 with an estimated 12 to 15 business day delivery window. It is now January 5, 2021 and still no sign of my order. Missed Christmas gifts are not good! Will not order again."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T16:23:21Z,1,I never got my order website is a scam
PupSocks,2021-01-05T16:23:08Z,5,Such a cool gift for my wife and the socks looked GREAT !!!
PupSocks,2021-01-05T16:20:30Z,5,Very nice socks. Our pup’s faces were adorable.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T16:20:15Z,5,"Pup socks has been awesome. There was a hiccup with my second order due to the holiday crush of orders, but they were so kind and generous in making it right. Two animal loving co-workers are now sporting their favorite pets, bringing smiles to their faces, especially since one is battling Covid presently but recovering. I recommend pup socks to all my friends!"
PupSocks,2021-01-05T16:19:33Z,2,"I did not get what I asked for. When you upload your pet picture there is a box to provide instructions. I asked for the whole dog, not just the face, and the blanket was delivered with only the face. If they couldn’t provide what I asked for, they should have contacted me to let me know. Very disappointing. I ordered the blanket in 11/23 and it wasn’t delivered until 12/26."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T16:18:23Z,1,Masks sent to friends have taken too long and communication is bad
PupSocks,2021-01-05T16:17:43Z,5,"While I was somewhat skeptical at first, I was extremely satisfied with the customized blanket they produced. It is extremely soft, the images of our dog are very high quality, and I expect it be around for years. In short, both my wife and I are so impressed with this company!"
PupSocks,2021-01-05T16:17:37Z,1,"I received the wrong blanket. It is the wrong color and has the picture of another dog on it. The socks we ordered do not appear to be kid sizes. I reached out to customer service, they responded that I cannot get a refund and have not heard any follow up since I asked to replace the incorrect items. The socks we did receive are a weird fabric. Would not recommend."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T16:17:20Z,1,I never received my package.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T16:16:59Z,1,I never received my order. Took forever to even confirm. I ordered in November and the socks are still not here. Total scam... DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT
PupSocks,2021-01-05T16:14:48Z,5,"The blanket and socks were a hit for Christmas! Big smiles with the pups faces everywhere, we got a good laugh straight out of the box! Blanket is very soft, socks feel more like dress socks but thicker. Would recommend and will do this again in the future."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T16:13:06Z,5,The sucks look great! One of my cats ears was cropped off though I'm not sure why. But they look amazing I ordered 7 different styles
PupSocks,2021-01-05T16:12:44Z,3,"Disappointed,  took over 6 weeks to get socks.  Then I got 2 pairs 1 with what I wanted and one with a dog face on it that I did not order.  Not sure what happened there.  Socks feel weird and not like regular socks. Daughter liked them so I guess it is good but would not order again until some things get fixed."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T16:11:17Z,2,"Cute and the puppies look adorable! Unfortunately I ordered small, kids socks and they are huge. Neither of my kids can wear."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T16:08:14Z,2,"I hate writing a bad review when they have done some things to rectify the situation, however, to date I have yet to receive my order which is now going on a month and a half. I understand the postal service issues and I’m willing to wait, but to send me this review at this time is probably bad timing on the companies part. I’m still holding out hope that I receive my order, and if I do I would be happy to update this review, but for now it hasn’t been the best experience and sending this review questionnaire before receiving my order doesn’t give me much hope."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T16:07:53Z,2,"Cute idea but the socks (1) were (even though the size was selected properly) too small and (2) they are “tube socks” which are fundamentally uncomfortable.  Wanted it to be a special Xmas gift, ended up being a “dud”"
PupSocks,2021-01-05T16:06:43Z,4,"Great service, delivery and quality of material. Faces of my dog and cat were a bit warped and dark."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T16:03:19Z,1,I ordered 2 months ago. Still didn't get my product! So you are asking me for a review and really this is the only review I can give at this point. I'm always open to changing my review in the future if things change.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T16:02:23Z,1,The socks I received in the mail did NOT match the pictures I sent. At all.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T16:02:19Z,1,"I was sent the wrong pair of socks- not my pup on them! And it's been over a month since I ordered, I've reached out to customer service twice and haven't even received a response. Since my order status is listed as ""completed,"" I don't even know if anyone is aware that I was sent the wrong item, despite my messages. So still don't have my socks, don't know when they are coming, don't even know if they are coming, don't know if I can get a refund, don't know who else to contact, and to top it off, I keep getting emails to review the order I haven't received. Will not be ordering again."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T16:01:29Z,1,The socks are very poor quality and the fit for my son was totally incorrect. For the price I expected a lot better.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T15:59:51Z,1,Only received half of items purchased.  Customer support not responding over last month.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T15:59:29Z,5,The PupSocks I ordered were great! They were a Christmas gift for my niece and she loved them. It was very easy to place the order and it was nice to give a unique and personalized gift.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T15:58:16Z,2,"Aesthetically the design is pretty good, the quality of the socks however is terrible. Considering how popular PupSocks are I assumed they would be held to a higher standard production wise."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T15:57:43Z,4,Socks good. Fit feet. Look nice.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T15:56:57Z,5,Excellent product.   The family loved it.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T15:56:41Z,1,I have an outstanding order from 11/23/20 that is still “in production!”  I’ve emailed the company twice with no response.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T15:53:43Z,5,"Socks are great. My wife loved them. Only issues was with the delivery time, which is 100% not your fault."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T15:53:05Z,1,"took way too long, dont even want to gift them at this point"
PupSocks,2021-01-05T15:51:11Z,3,"I wish I could give all five stars since I am a repeat customer, but I placed my order on November 23rd for a blanket and socks and still have not received my order. The gift was for my daughter for Christmas and such a bummer not to have it by now! Would have been helpful to know the production time on the front-end! Hoping to have it soon."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T15:50:30Z,4,"The socks are very good quality and the picture quality is much better than I was expecting. My only complaint is that they took six weeks to arrive from the time I ordered them. I think this is because of the holiday rush and covid-19, but I thought they weren’t coming for a while. My recommendation if you are getting these as a gift is to order them very far in advance."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T15:49:11Z,4,"The socks are adorable but the fit is weird, too tight and bunchy around ankles and too big in toe area."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T15:47:04Z,1,"I ordered my socks on the 6th of December. They were not shipped until the 18th. I was told in ordering I should receive my order in 8-10 business days, not for it to be shipped on the 10th business day. I understand holiday backlog l, but an email would have been nice as I then would have changed the shipping address so the recipient could have received it on time for Christmas. Just frustrating because if pupsocks was honest about their timelines my sister would have gotten her Christmas gift on time."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T15:46:40Z,5,So great! My boys loved them.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T15:45:56Z,5,My wife loved her gift!
PupSocks,2021-01-05T15:44:50Z,1,"This place is a SCAM!! Ordered over a month ago and not only is it still not here, but they refuse to do anything to help solve the problem. Either resend or give me my money back! Worst customer service I've ever experienced. Please don't buy from here"
PupSocks,2021-01-05T15:42:42Z,1,I still havnt gotten my order its been a month and no one has contacted me back.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T15:40:50Z,5,My husband loved them‼️
PupSocks,2021-01-05T15:40:39Z,1,"If I wanted socks with a stranger’s face and pet on them they would be perfect.  After several attempts to contact them I have still received no reply, no refund, no exchange, just several emails wanting me to buy more.  The quality appears good, but again I did not receive what I ordered!!"
PupSocks,2021-01-05T15:40:36Z,2,Made two orders and the shipping is so slow!! Both orders took almost a month to receive. I am still waiting on an order placed December 12. The shipping notice was sent in December 21 and it says it takes 5 business days to receive and I am still waiting on them. Quality is ok. The novelty of them has worn off due to the slow shipping time.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T15:39:31Z,5,Bought them for my daughter!  They were so cute!!  She loved them so I bought her another pair.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T15:38:49Z,1,Haven’t received them (supposed to arrive almost a month ago) and nobody has responded to my emails :(
PupSocks,2021-01-05T15:37:59Z,5,Great quality and the perfect gift for really any occasion. My stepdad loved them!
PupSocks,2021-01-05T15:37:59Z,5,Excellent product at a great price - delivered and enjoyed as expected!
PupSocks,2021-01-05T15:37:49Z,5,I got my mom these socks for Christmas with both of her cats faces on it and she LOVED IT! I was worried about one of the pictures I sent in because I thought one of the cats images may not have been as close to the camera but the Pupsock team did an excellent job getting both of her cats faces on her socks! It he quality of the images on the socks were very high
PupSocks,2021-01-05T15:34:50Z,5,"Easy to order, fast to ship and it made her day to see her cat on the blanket. The product itself is nicely made and should last a while even with heavy use. I’m glad I made this purchase."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T15:33:37Z,2,Cute execution on puppy image but poor quality.  My family was excited to open them for Christmas but I doubt they will wear them.   Not worth the money.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T15:33:35Z,5,"I ordered a pair of these socks for my grandson and put his new puppy, TINA on them. He loves them and does not want to wear any other socks! They are very high-quality and fit good."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T15:32:03Z,1,Still have never received my item and it’s been over a month and a half. No tracking order and horrible customer service! Basically at this point I feel like I’ve been ripped off!!!!
PupSocks,2021-01-05T15:30:27Z,5,I have ordered 4 different pairs of socks and they have all turned out amazing! The quality is awesome and the shipping is fast! I will definitely be ordering again in the future! Would recommend for any pet lovers out there!
PupSocks,2021-01-05T15:30:02Z,5,Looked great and great quality!
PupSocks,2021-01-05T15:29:56Z,5,"Bought these socks on a whim, and was totally impressed. Very good quality, and the cat face is perfect! Really cute idea!"
PupSocks,2021-01-05T15:29:42Z,1,It's been a month I'm still not receive my order
PupSocks,2021-01-05T15:26:30Z,2,"These socks are super cute! But - they are also very oddly made. They are quite tight and uncomfortable and the sizing and foot proportion is very odd. The fabric is also very weird. I bought these for my husband as a gift. He won't actually wear them because of the fit and quality, but enjoyed the novelty of having our puppy on them."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T15:23:55Z,1,I have not received my order.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T15:21:02Z,4,"Adorable gift for my daughter. We had her cat's face printed on these socks. The printing was really great and they got here fast. But, the fabric is weird. They aren't cozy, knit socks. That said, my daughter loves them and doesn't mind the weird material at all. If you're expecting ""warm, cozy"" socks ... these are more polyester-ish."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T15:18:45Z,5,Socks arrived exactly as shown. The image and color is clear and vivid. THE fabric is comfortable. I will be buying more! Would highly recommend.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T15:15:42Z,1,I have not received my order as yet?! It has been about a month at leastCould someone please give me some feedback regarding my order
PupSocks,2021-01-05T15:14:49Z,1,Ordered on Nov 22.  Website stated item would ship in 4 days.  Did not ship until mid December during the holiday rush.  Was not delivered in time for Christmas present.  Finally revived it Jan 4.Their customer service ignored all but one of my emails to them.  When they finally got back to me it was 5 days after the email was sent.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T15:14:02Z,5,Adorable! Came out great and exactly what I expected. It was a gift and my brother in law loved them!
PupSocks,2021-01-05T15:13:34Z,5,Socks are perfect. I am in Canada so shipping took about a month around Christmas but that’s to be expected.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T15:12:37Z,1,"Ordered basic, 1 face socks. They sent the wrong socks. I informed that they sent the wrong socks, they informed they were sending the socks i actually ordered. They were originally supposed to be delivered Dec. 18th. It’s now Jan. 5th, and still do not have the correct socks. Was supposed to be Christmas gift, but i guess with this business speed, we’ll shoot for next Christmas."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T15:10:57Z,3,"The idea of PupSocks is awesome but their holiday staffing/ turnaround time was abysmal. My mother-in-law received hers on January 2nd, 2021 and my husband’s got delivered even later to her and when she opened it, it wasn’t her pet on the socks. Recommendation is don’t stop buying PupSocks but also don’t count on them to be a holiday gift."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T15:06:06Z,1,I have ordered a pair of socks on November 23rd for $23.00. I expected the item to be delivered late due to all the delivery issues. I received my package on December 22 in a plastic bag type package which was torn open and empty. So no socks.  I emailed the company that day December 22 and I have yet to hear back from them except a general email stating they are behind on responding to emails. They are expensive socks it would have been nice for someone to address the issue a bit sooner.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T14:49:27Z,1,I ordered socks and blanket on December 4th and as of Jan 5th still have not received them.  They were shipped on Dec 24th so we did not receive them in time for Christmas.  Very disappointed.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T14:46:21Z,1,"Waited over 30 days for one pair of socks. I emailed them twice and they never responded. Their cancellation policy states, 'must be cancelled within 3 hours of ordering' they also keep $9 if it's after 3 hours. How can someone cancel in 3 hours when these people never return emails?"
PupSocks,2021-01-05T14:43:07Z,1,"Ordered at the beginning of Dec, promised deliver by Christmas and still haven't received my blanket,I'm very disappointed"
PupSocks,2021-01-05T14:40:16Z,5,Picture printed very clearly. Socks are cute--they're a shiny material but are comfy. Thanks!
PupSocks,2021-01-05T14:21:34Z,1,"Products arrived after Christmas when guaranteed to be before and they put human face on with dog face when I requested one face only, why didn't they ask if they weren't sure. Don't like the fabric or feel of the socks either and shaped odd. Very disappointed."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T14:21:25Z,5,Didn't know what to expect.  Found PupSocks on the Instagram app.  Ordered 3 blankets and a pair of socks for my wife and 2 children.  Beautifully done and exceeded my expectation!  5 stars!!!
PupSocks,2021-01-05T14:18:16Z,5,"Awesome, beautiful present!"
PupSocks,2021-01-05T14:10:24Z,5,Great depiction of my dog on the socks.  A big hit on Christmas!
PupSocks,2021-01-05T13:52:19Z,2,"I had a problem with the way one of the images turned out.  I sent a note, and heard back initially, but since they've gone silent.  I guess they don't intend to rectify the situation."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T13:51:31Z,3,"Graphics were good, but sock is strange, uncomfortable fabric. Not really usable"
PupSocks,2021-01-05T13:49:04Z,5,Good quality. Nicely done.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T13:46:07Z,1,"Expensive, which I was willing to pay for the novelty of it. Extremely poor quality material, poor design. The socks are literally like a tube with no shape and little give. They bunch without stretch and are tight around ankle, and loose around foot and calf. Customer service delayed, took a month to receive although consistent promises to get on time. Would never order again."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T13:38:39Z,5,I ordered a pair of these socks for each of my kids for Christmas and they absolutely LOVED them !   They are 15 & 19 years old and they actually said that they were their favorite gifts under the tree.  They turned out great!They even shipped pretty fast.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T13:07:58Z,1,The mailing time is ridiculously slow with no timely tracking information.  I ordered weeks ago and still have not received them.   Very disappointed.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T12:47:35Z,5,These are GREAT. I surprised my wife with these for Christmas with pics of our pup and she loved them! I should note that the designers at PupSocks also filled my special request for one of the pictures which made it even more special. They also we're able to get the order done and shipped to me just in time for Christmas! Thank you!
PupSocks,2021-01-05T12:19:01Z,5,The socks were a Christmas gift. My son in law loved them.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T12:06:15Z,1,Quality of sock is awful. Size is not accurate Picture was great Overall disappointed
PupSocks,2021-01-05T11:47:50Z,1,One star because I havent' yet received my order that was placed November 22/20. Received generic email response upon inquiry. Can't speak to the quality of the products until received so happy to append rating after order arrives for this family business.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T11:40:03Z,1,I ordered socks on December 9th and have still yet to receive them i go to the tracking number and it still says its in usps at Atlanta
PupSocks,2021-01-05T11:39:14Z,1,Order was delayed without any communication. I reached out to customer service to inquire and NEVER heard back. I’d recommend investing more in customer service and less in advertising. Was not happy with experience and won’t be recommending to others.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T11:36:07Z,2,"The socks just arrived after being ordered in mid November. The print was very cute, but the comfort is lacking 100%. Lots of money for a novelty gift."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T11:20:34Z,5,Socks are fabulous and I can't wait to give them as gifts! My whole family loved them and everybody wants a pair - even our doggie!
PupSocks,2021-01-05T11:02:05Z,1,I still haven’t got them! It’s been months
PupSocks,2021-01-05T10:51:33Z,2,"Not happy with my Pup Socks. Poor experience over all including... - Ordering, the key-art and images were small and hard to see when ordering on a laptop (I'm 39 years old, avid eCommerce shopper). Hard to differentiate between Pup, Cat, Human sock designs.  - I ordered my Socks in Mid-Nov 2020 and they were finally delivered on Jan 5 2021 (after the holidays). A bummer as the 4 pairs I ordered were holiday gifts.  - Communication with customer support was wonky, I asked ""why"" it was taking so long and got a bunch of automated responses, not really giving me any context.  - Quality is ""ok"", not super stoked based on what they cost."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T10:38:00Z,5,These were a great gift! The pictures on the socks were just like I sent. My daughter loved them!
PupSocks,2021-01-05T09:31:49Z,1,"Ordered in November, still no delivery in mid-January."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T09:11:56Z,5,Purchased a blanket and socks for my niece and she loved it.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T08:54:20Z,1,I have still not received my socks despite ordering them in November! I would avoid this company.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T07:45:31Z,5,Ordered two pairs of socks as gifts. They are both so cute.  Both recipients loved them!!
PupSocks,2021-01-05T07:17:39Z,1,I ordered my item over a month ago and still don't have it.  Something happened in shipping and it took multiple emails to customer service to get a response which was to wait another week.  I waited and still have no answer to my follow up emails and no socks or refund.  Terrible customer service and very disappointed I never received my item or my money back.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T06:45:28Z,5,The cat socks that I ordered were amazing! My cat’s face looked very realistic on the socks!
PupSocks,2021-01-05T06:34:03Z,1,"Terrible. Wrong style socks. Wrong pup. I contacted the company, and they blamed the post office for the mixup. They told me to wait after I contacted them twice at Christmas, 2 weeks ago, because they’re backlogged."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T05:33:38Z,1,"These socks are terrible. The material is terrible, they are not normal socks with normal heels. They are completely the wrong shape to fit anyone. I ordered 5 pairs in various sizes, and received all extra larges, so none of them fit anyone.They also took 4 weeks to receive so there was no time to return or exchange prior to Christmas"
PupSocks,2021-01-05T05:16:36Z,2,Slow delivery. Quality was less than what I expected sizing was off. Cute idea though.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T05:01:13Z,5,Socks were a great gift. The quality looks good and my girfriend wa super happy about them.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T05:00:38Z,5,The finished product was nice. Good job!
PupSocks,2021-01-05T04:40:33Z,1,Still haven’t received my product that I ordered over a month ago...
PupSocks,2021-01-05T04:31:34Z,5,Absolutely love them and the quality is great!! Long lasting!
PupSocks,2021-01-05T04:23:06Z,1,Been over a month. Tracking stopped updating 2 weeks ago
PupSocks,2021-01-05T04:09:59Z,5,We love our purchases!
PupSocks,2021-01-05T04:03:41Z,5,The pup socks were perfect for my exhusband. He loved the fact that his new puppy was on his socks
PupSocks,2021-01-05T04:02:43Z,5,"Made socks for my family of our recently deceased pet. The whole process was super easy. The shipping was a bit delayed, but I ordered around Christmas and do not blame the company for their wait times. Tears were definitely shed and I have gotten many compliments. I feel her close to me when I wear these socks."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T04:01:00Z,5,"This was my first time using this company and I had a great experience. I ordered two pairs for two of my sisters for Christmas and the product turned out exactly as I had hoped. I was able to put two dogs on one of the pairs of socks, which was a great option. Shipping was quick too, even in a crazy year. A little pricey, but makes a great gift."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T03:57:44Z,1,Ordered these socks 6 weeks ago. I still haven’t received them. What a joke! I will never use this company again.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T03:48:17Z,5,"I was incredibly pleased with how the pup masks turned out. My only gripe is that it took much longer than I anticipated to receive them, and much longer than you stated on your website when I ordered them. Most of mine were out of town gifts and I had to mail out my packages before I received them. Thus, I had to send separate packages with the masks when I finally received them from you."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T03:45:38Z,5,Perfect 👌🏼
PupSocks,2021-01-05T03:45:17Z,1,Absolutely terrible unwearable socks. Cat picture turned out well but it’s printed on plastic feeling socks that have no shape and cannot be worn. Dont waste your money.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T03:45:14Z,3,I ordered the beginning of December and had no idea if I was going to get the item for Christmas.  I contacted support and they failed to communicate back in a reasonable amount of time.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T03:40:27Z,5,"We loved, loved, loved them. Thanks!"
PupSocks,2021-01-05T03:36:01Z,2,The socks were not soft like ones I had ordered in the last.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T03:32:19Z,1,"I accidentally placed my cat’s photo on a dog blanket online and placed the order.  Within 5 minutes after placing the order, I noticed my error and emailed that it needs changed to a cat blanket.  I was told no changes are allowed.  So now I’m stuck with a cat’s photo on a dog blanket.  This will be the first and last item I ever buy from your company."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T03:24:36Z,1,"I ordered 4 pairs of PupSocks for Christmas gifts. It took a long time to get the socks, and I was very disappointed when they arrived. The fit and quality of the socks is terrible. They don’t stay up, and the material is strange-not soft or natural feeling. I ordered a 5th pair for my daughter from a different company on Amazon. They were half the price and came before the Pup socks, even though I ordered a couple weeks after. The quality and fit of the Amazon socks are much better, too. Even though I was very disappointed in the PupSocks, the customer service seems genuine and sincere. I just hope I helped some animals in need."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T03:23:39Z,5,The BEST gift!!!
PupSocks,2021-01-05T03:22:51Z,5,"I ordered a blanket with our furgirl's picture on it (face), and was so happy with how the blanket turned out! I love it and so does my son and husband. The blanket is soft too!!"
PupSocks,2021-01-05T03:20:30Z,5,They were a gift for my daughter n law and she loved them!  Great product..  Thanks
PupSocks,2021-01-05T03:20:18Z,5,The Sox I ordered turned out perfect!  My wife loves them!
PupSocks,2021-01-05T03:13:50Z,1,Sent the wrong socks with the wrong dog and never sent me a refund after it was requested two times. Basically took my money and had a product that I did not want.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T03:06:41Z,1,"Can I give ZERO stars??? Ordered early December for a Christmas Gift.  Seller says 2-day shipping is required for Christmas Delivery and offers a money back guarantee.  Paid for Gift Wrapping as well.Received my package on 12/28, 3 days late, with no gift wrapping.  Waste of $17 on excess shipping and gift wrapping costs.  No response from them by e-mail about my refund, but got an automated email with a COUPON FOR ANOTHER ORDER.  No thanks, trash company."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T03:05:30Z,1,Still haven’t received or heard updates ordered December 12th ...not sure if this is a scan ...buyer beware.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T02:59:46Z,2,"Picture quality is good however the sock itself is cheap, appears faded, and the band along the top looks nothing like the picture online. The fabric doesn’t even feel like nice quality. Also took a month to get here. They sent a picture of the product prior to it arriving and the quality of the sock looks nothing like what I received. Overall not pleased with the purchase."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T02:46:38Z,5,My order was not correct the first time out and they quickly rectified the matter. My son received the socks in time for Christmas. They turned out so cute.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T02:46:25Z,1,The socks came on 1/4 even though they were ordered on 12/6 and delivery was supposed to be before Christmas. They arrived and are very ill fitting and not comfortable. I would not recommend this product to anyone.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T02:42:20Z,1,"Hi Pupsocks,I have ordered 2 pairs of socks over one month ago which I have not received yet. These were meant to be a Christmas presents from my family. I have sent an email to your organisation two weeks ago and to the courier also and have not received any word back from either of you. Where are my socks and how much longer will they take? I would honestly prefer a refund if you cannot give me a realistic timeline. Kind regards,Bradley"
PupSocks,2021-01-05T02:32:48Z,1,"It’s been a month since ordering and no updates as to when it will ship. Terrible customer service. Terrible communication. Of course, my credit card was charged right away. There are many other companies out there for this product. Choose ANY other."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T02:27:11Z,4,"Product is awesome ! Good job.Ordered for Xmas on Dec.6 , received on Jan.4th .... so was not happy with production time being WAY longer than estimated . Work on being honest with production time !"
PupSocks,2021-01-05T02:23:39Z,5,"The socks made for an amazing gift! High quality. The socks arrived in a package that said pup socks all over it—I wish it came in more anonymous packaging because it was very obvious what it was when it came, and ruined the surprise. But the purchase is loved and I will def do it again."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T02:13:18Z,4,Ordering the socks was simple and they were delivered within 2 weeks. The image quality was very good and the socks are pretty good quality too. Just a word caution though...the socks are not tapered towards the toe so they do fit a little weird unless you have very wide feet. Definitely a unique gift to give.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T02:06:00Z,1,Total scam company. I ordered custom sock and was sent 3 pair of $1 store socks.There has been no response from the company.They have a terrible rating with the BBC.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T02:03:30Z,5,Great product and fast service and shipping. Thanks.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T01:55:31Z,5,I wasn't sure when I ordered how it would look because you don't get a good visual on the order. I have to say I zoomed with my friend and got the mash up blanket/sock combe and LOVED the way it turned out. She was very happy with the quality also.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T01:45:53Z,3,Cute idea and pic of animal is great.  Sizes run way too big and material of sock is horrible
PupSocks,2021-01-05T01:44:36Z,1,I’ve ordered socks from here before and had no problems but this time I ordered a blanket and received a wrong order. I’ve been trying to get in contact with customer service for weeks but no one has answered. I figured since they were a small business they’d put their priority on having great customer service. I just want my pup blanket !! 😩
PupSocks,2021-01-05T01:42:06Z,2,Ordered Nov 30 in time for Christmas.  STILL not here as of Jan 4 . . . .
PupSocks,2021-01-05T01:41:15Z,2,Picture on socks were great but the socks themselves are not of good quality they are not fitted and are like 1970 tube socks.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T01:39:41Z,1,I received someone else’s person socks not my pup socks .... this saddens me I have reached out immediately upon receiving the wrong socks and still no answer....
PupSocks,2021-01-05T01:39:31Z,1,Socks were cheep and very uncomfortable.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T01:33:15Z,1,It’s been over a month since I placed my order and I have yet received it.  There is no number to call and no one responds to emails. There is no way to track your order.   I would definitely not recommend this company.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T01:29:51Z,1,Horrible quality. These items are Chinese junk. Do not waste your money. You will want a refund if you buy ANYTHING.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T01:28:37Z,3,"Unfortunately, I found the sizing very confusing and thought I was ordering women’s’.  I received men’s sizes and socks cannot be worn.  Ears were not shown on one of the dog pics but maybe I should have sent a better photo?  Disappointed but my fault I guess."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T01:26:04Z,5,"Quick turn around time. Photo looked great and was cropped perfectly. The socks were a little thin, but I didn't know what to expect, so no complaints."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T01:20:37Z,1,"I ordered my socks November 30th to allow plenty of time to have the socks before Christmas.  The socks did arrive several days before Christmas but I was sent the wrong order.  I sent an email to customer service immediately and did not hear back for about a week.  Once I finally did receive a response they said we will ship you a complimentary order.  I questioned how is it complimentary if I already paid for the socks and still have not received them.  I'm still waiting for an answer to my question and it has been over 2 weeks.  I get another email saying my socks have been shipped.  Great, let's see if they arrive.  Then I get another email giving me a tracking number.  I clicked on the tracking number and it it to a residence in TX...I live in NJ.  You just can't get anything correct.  I don't know how you are in business.  I will be reporting this the BBB."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T01:12:12Z,1,They’re not socks! Can’t wear them. Total ripoff!
PupSocks,2021-01-05T01:09:16Z,3,I made a request for the 2 pairs of socks that bought with 2 different pets on each pair. And 1 pair came with 1 face. (Which is what I wanted) but the other pair came with both animals face.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T01:08:24Z,5,Who doesn't want to see themselves or their pets on their socks?
PupSocks,2021-01-05T01:07:36Z,1,"Ordering from this website was hell.My order was incredibly delayed, the crop that they did to my dog was horrendous, and they forgot a pair of socks from my order. I'm better off getting iron on patches than ordering from this place again."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T01:07:02Z,5,I really enjoy the appearance of the custom socks i ordered. Tracking my order was great and they came in just before Christmas.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T01:04:59Z,5,Besides the shipping delay in part of the holidays the order was fantastic.  The socks look great.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T00:59:13Z,1,Sent wrong order. Still haven't heard back from anyone.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T00:58:30Z,3,Really cute socks with the photo but the quality of material was extremely poor.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T00:55:59Z,5,"The socks were very nice, unfortunately they did not arrive in time for Christmas. Not your fault, but still disappointing."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T00:54:20Z,3,Still have not received my item. It’s been almost a month since my order date.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T00:48:16Z,5,I ordered a blanket and socks with our cats face on them as a gift for my brother as our cat now lives with him. I couldn't be happier with this product. The blanket was so soft and the picture is crystal clear! It is so adorable. I'm considering ordering another blanket for my kids as they are definitely jealous and hi jacked the blanket for themselves a few times! Highly recommend!!!
PupSocks,2021-01-05T00:46:43Z,5,"Better than expected! The socks turned out so cute and my sister loved them! Arrived quickly, the whole ordering process was easy."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T00:42:31Z,1,Been over a month since ive ordered and still havent received.  100% wont order again.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T00:36:40Z,1,"I ordered these the end of Nov. You sent me a mock up and that they were shipped. I have not seen them?? It was a Christmas present.... Will I be seeing them soon? I hope! If not, a refund would be nice!"
PupSocks,2021-01-05T00:31:23Z,5,"Large, soft blanket. Cropping of my dog was perfect! Great gift idea for anyone with a pet"
PupSocks,2021-01-05T00:28:23Z,1,They Haven’t Arrived Yet???
PupSocks,2021-01-05T00:27:54Z,5,Thank you for capturing the personality of our dog on these socks. They were a huge hit and made a special kid's Christmas though through the Covid troubles a couple of days late.
PupSocks,2021-01-05T00:17:26Z,1,"Do not waste your money. Not only did I wait a month to get my order, but I received the wrong order! I definitely do not recommend."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T00:12:50Z,1,I ordered on November 27th and my order never arrived yet. Its January 4th. It would be a Christmas gift.  I guess not.😥
PupSocks,2021-01-05T00:11:51Z,2,"So far I’m not too impressed.  My dog,s face turned out well, but I ordered them for my granddaughter, who is 1 1/2 years old, and they sent me an adult size.  I emailed them immediately, and have still not heard back.  It’s been over 2 weeks.  I’m very disappointed in the lack of response on a solution."
PupSocks,2021-01-05T00:10:42Z,5,"I received my socks as a gift and absolutely love them! They are comfortable, warm and fit well. And, the picture of my pet appears detailed and adorable!"
PupSocks,2021-01-05T00:07:28Z,3,"Quality of material was ok, but the color was not the same as on picture. Plus, pup’s ear was cut, so it did not look great. Overall, average, could have been better. Great idea though. But I would not recommend picking yellow color and I would advise cutting the pic yourself."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T23:56:45Z,1,The picture of the cat was nothing like the photo I submitted. Plus the designer didn’t follow my specific instructions. The quality is also not up to par with the price. I wish I could give it 0 stars
PupSocks,2021-01-04T23:51:26Z,1,"Ordered well before the holidays and was promised delivery in time for Christmas, here we are more than a week after Christmas and still no delivery. My special surprise for my wife was absolutely ruined! Will never order from this horrible company again, pandemic or not!! They SUCK!!!!!"
PupSocks,2021-01-04T23:50:16Z,1,I ordered these in early December as a Christmas gift.  it is now January 4th and they are nowhere to be seen.  You really need to find some alternative to whatever shipping service you are now using.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T23:50:15Z,1,I have a Black Pit Bull.  I ordered a white blanket with her face on it.  I received a red blanket with a black lab.  It's clear received someone's else's order and I've reached out multiple times via email (no phone # to call) and received automated responses about the backlog of shipping times from USPS.  I assume I'll never see the blanket for my wife (a Christmas gift) or a refund of my money.  That's why you don't buy stuff from Instagram ads.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T23:49:19Z,4,I love the socks and my kids do too! He picture came out perfect. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it would have been great to have a choice of athletic socks or the dress style socks that they came as.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T23:44:33Z,5,I gave the socks as a gift and they were amazed by them and thought they were the best Christmas gift ever! Hoping to purchase a blanket in the near future! Would totally recommend.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T23:43:59Z,3,"I ordered 1 pair with 1 image, those were great! The other 2 pair of socks I ordered with 2 images I was disappointed in how 1 image of my dogs face was cropped. It does not even look like her. Otherwise I would have given a 5 star review!"
PupSocks,2021-01-04T23:43:47Z,1,"I still have not received my order.  I ordered it on December 3rd, and it's now a month later and I still don't have it, but they have my money.  I will never order from them again."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T23:41:16Z,1,Received socks instead of a blanket with a different pets face on them. Sent them multiple emails with no response. Reported it through PayPal then they finally responded saying they have created a new order and it will be shipped ASAP and I will receive a new tracking number. Did not receive any of this however. Never received my order.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T23:36:10Z,5,These were a huge hit for Christmas! Arrived in plenty of time and the materialIs perfect! Great colors and image looks great while wearing socks.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T23:31:06Z,1,"I received socks I ordered for my 8 year old daughter. They got the wrong size (sent adult), the wrong color (ordered purple, got blue, and got the wrong dog! I’ve sent two emails and have not gotten a response."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T23:30:25Z,5,"This was the Christmas present for my cousin and she loved it! Seriously, the faces of her three dogs look sooo perfect on those socks. THANK YOU! 100% recommended."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T23:29:58Z,3,Socks are not comfortable. I'm not pleased with the material at all. Not enough stretch. They look adorable but the designers must consider different material.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T23:20:03Z,1,"I ordered on Dec 4 and it is now Jan 4 and I still haven't received my order. It said it was sent on Dec 19, but the tracking number hasn't even been accepted by USPS yet."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T23:07:53Z,1,I received the wrong order and have tried to contact them via email 3 times.  The only response that I’ve gotten is an automatic that goes out to all.  So disappointed as this was supposed to be a gift. And I still can’t get a person to respond to my issue. Stay away from this company.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T23:07:37Z,4,"4 out of the 5 pairs of socks I ordered are fantastic! There was an issue with one pair, which I have reached out to the customer service team about. Other than that one issue, I'm very happy with my order! The pictures came out so much clearer than I would've thought on the socks! I did suggest in my email to customer service that it might be worth considering sending mockups for approval for custom orders with a disclaimer that feedback is needed within 48 hours or the order will be completed as is. I would've caught the issue on my order if this had been the case. But still a positive experience!"
PupSocks,2021-01-04T23:07:33Z,5,These socks were a big hit with my kids.  They looked great and seem to be well made.  Will order more in the future!
PupSocks,2021-01-04T23:03:16Z,3,"The socks I ordered are super cute! I gave them to my boyfriend for Christmas with our cat's face on them and he loved them. I was a bit dissatisfied with the texture of the socks - they aren't soft and have more of a sports-like material than I was expecting. There was also a box for requests/comments when I made my order, so I asked them to include as much of the fur around my cats face as possible (he has a big fluffy beard), but to my disappointment they cropped his face so he pretty much looked like a short-haired cat. At the end of the day, my boyfriend still loved them, but I don't see a point to having the comment/request box there if the comments don't get relayed."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T23:01:07Z,5,Happy with the end result. Thanks Pupsocks
PupSocks,2021-01-04T22:59:54Z,4,I had a blanket and socks made up for my niece with photos of her kitty.  She LOVES it!!!  She takes it with her everywhere.  ...and now her sister wants one so I guess you'll be hearing from us again soon!
PupSocks,2021-01-04T22:59:20Z,3,"I am not one to write reviews but feel this is warranted. I ordered on 23 Nov for guaranteed Xmas delivery. I am to this day (5 Jan) still waiting for my order to arrive. After I sent two enquiries the week leading up to Xmas with no response to either, I received a email to say sorry we are experiencing delivery delays and was provided with a printable image on Xmas Eve of my order to gift to the people I had ordered them for along with 40% off my next order from memory. Some people would have liked the idea of a printable image but some like me probably want to keep their present a surprise until the actual order arrives. What frustrates me the most is that with the covid pandemic and one of the most busiest times of the year you can market “guaranteed Xmas delivery” and not deliver on your promise and blame it on heavy demand or postage delays. Well of course you are going to experience that. To me that is false advertising and misleading your customers."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T22:54:50Z,1,You literally sent me the completely wrong item. This was the worst customer experience I have ever had.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T22:49:47Z,1,"I ordered the wrong thing (my bad) and attempted to correct it 15 minutes later. No one contacted me until a day later and by then it was too late. I canceled my order and because I didn’t cancel within three hours, they charged me a cancellation fee."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T22:45:58Z,1,Ordered 5 pair on Black Friday (November) & still haven’t received them (01/04/2021) 😕
PupSocks,2021-01-04T22:44:23Z,5,They did a really good job with the socks and my girlfriend was super pleased with the final product. Will definitely use Pup Socks again soon!
PupSocks,2021-01-04T22:39:35Z,1,"The socks are cute, but the material and the shape of sock is horrible. Not comfortable, not made to have a ""fit"" and have a weird seam down the side of the foot. Was ordered on December 3rd, not received until January 4th. They didn't ""travel the world to find the best yarn"", they used an uncomfortable polyester. This was supposed to be a fun gift for my daughter and I am totally disappointed!"
PupSocks,2021-01-04T22:38:54Z,1,"Over 40 days, no product has arrived, tracking number not valid, awful customer service, don't waste your money."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T22:38:49Z,1,the mask is just not good
PupSocks,2021-01-04T22:38:43Z,2,"The size of the sock was not as it indicated on the website. In addition to that, they fit like tubes and were comically ill fitting.  one of the images on the socks was good, the other one did not come out well. In their defense that image was a bit odd but I made a request for them to include a portion of the image which they trimmed off. All in all, it will be an peculiar Christmas memory but not worth the money. I did have a blanket and sock set made for another gift and, while the image quality was better, the socks fit poorly."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T22:38:31Z,1,Couldn't tell you the quality of it because I haven't even received it. Ordered on Dec 1st it is now Jan 4.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T22:38:29Z,5,My mom loved the customized socks with our three cats!!! Great service thank you.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T22:37:43Z,3,"The socks came out cute, but the image of my cat seemed faded and not clear enough. I wish the image stood out more."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T22:35:35Z,5,I ordered three pairs of socks and a large blanket and I’m very happy with everything. The blanket is huge and very fuzzy. The socks are soft and cozy. Quality of the photos are great!
PupSocks,2021-01-04T22:35:04Z,1,"I ordered two pairs of socks.  One arrived correctly, while the other had the wrong picture printed on them.  It took over 5 days and multiple emails to even hear back form the company.  Then, it took multiple tries to hear from them after my second email.  The process for confirming that I got the wrong order (taking pictures and sending them, as well as pictures of my original order form) was tedious.  Again, it took days to hear something.  After this, they wanted to resend the product, but I asked for a refund.  Again, they eventually came through with the refund, but it took well over a week.  I had actually given up hope and thought I would just have to eat the money.  This company did not seem prepared to take care of my customer service needs.  I will not order from them in the future."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T22:34:33Z,1,"I made my order almost 2 months ago and it's just now in transit.  Wasn't even shipped until Christmas, and ironically it was supposed to be a Christmas present.  I paid $60 for 2 stupid pairs of socks with pictures of cats on them AFTER the holiday discount (because apparently I'm an idiot) and the least they could do is get these things to me on time.  What's their response? ""Sorry, we'll give you a 50% off coupon if you still want your items, "" As if I'll ever buy from them again.  Screw Pupsocks - I'd sooner light my money on fire next time."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T22:34:05Z,5,I got a pair of these with our pup on it for my husband- he loved them! Really high quality photo. So cute and funny!
PupSocks,2021-01-04T22:32:52Z,2,"The socks are cute, but the quality of the fabric is scratchy and very uncomfortable and are just about the worst fitting socks I’ve ever seen. Not too thrilled at all."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T22:27:10Z,1,This was a terrible experience.  Arrived after Christmas (despite getting email saying it was doing to arrive before).  Wrong photos on socks and really low quality so they are not for wearing. Contacted company several times and no response.  Got an automated response saying this is unprecedented times but then saw they sent this out every Christmas as they ran into the same issue.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T22:25:50Z,3,The socks are not quite what I expected.  The images I sent look like they were put in a stock sizing and really dont capture what my cats look like at all.  The socks themselves too look fairly cheaply made and have a plastic type material that is not very pleasant looking or feeling. Overall not impressed.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T22:21:21Z,5,"I love love love my socks!  They are purrrfect and high quality.  Ordering was easy, quick and efficient.  Delivery took a little longer than I expected but I ordered during the holiday season so I understand!  I did contact customer service and they responded immediately!  I can't wait to order more items.  My daughter thought these were the cutest socks she has ever seen!!!!  Great product and great service!!!"
PupSocks,2021-01-04T22:18:19Z,1,"Poor Service & Delivery:  The order was placed on November 23.  The status of the order has shown up as ""In Production"" since that time.  I sent an email requesting update on order on Dec 10 and I didn't get a response until Dec 18 with no new information other than it's ""In Production"".  I was told that any order placed before Dec 11 was being prioritized but without any further info.  I sent a subsequent email requesting further information on Dec 21 and to date have not received any feedback.  This was supposed to be a birthday gift on Dec 18th which was missed.  Also missed a chance to be a xmas gift.  I would say, overall, that this has been a poor experience both in terms of wait time clearly but also in terms of responsiveness and overall customer service.  I would cancel this order if your site provided some means to do so.  I certainly will not be ordering anything else from PupSocks nor will I recommend it to anyone that I know."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T22:18:15Z,2,"Ordered my socks on November 23, they shipped the 28 - did not get them in time for Xmas but I was messaging the company multiple times and I never got the emails they sent back for some reason. It shows they responded but I never got them. After hoping I would receive my order for Xmas I finally got a delivery date for January 7. I understand covid is screwing things up and things are backed up but while I was waiting for my order I saw the promotion to order by December 20 and have it in time for New Years so that upset me that whoever ordered by then would get theirs quickly but I ordered well in advanced for Xmas and still didn’t receive it on time."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T22:17:02Z,5,"My daughter lost her dog, and we had them printed for Christmas.  It was her best gift!!!"
PupSocks,2021-01-04T22:15:58Z,1,I got a blanket with two dogs who weren’t mine. I have never heard back from customer support.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T22:07:46Z,1,"Well, after waiting over 5 weeks, we finally got our pup  masks today.  WORST. QUALITY. EVER.  The masks are small, no place for a filter, made of polyester, and SMELL.  What a waste of a cute puppy face."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T22:07:14Z,5,"Adorable! Images came out perfectly. Also, a great fit and very comfortable."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T21:56:19Z,2,I received someone’s else’s order
PupSocks,2021-01-04T21:54:04Z,1,"This was a Christmas present that was ordered LONG ago (November 28th) and in plenty of time for Christmas. From all indications from PupSocks, it was guaranteed to get to me before Christmas and no problem to Canada.  The tracking number shows that it is STILL in Florida on January 4th.  lol.  Absolutely ridiculous purchase, and never again.  Stupid ad that came up on facebook, thought it was a cute idea for the wife, and fell for it.  Lesson learned."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T21:53:31Z,4,Great socks just a little thin but my daughter loved them.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T21:51:07Z,5,Great quality! I am super impressed with the socks and the quality of the images. I bought them as a Christmas gift for my husband and he was so excited when he saw them. I highly recommend them and will definitely purchase again
PupSocks,2021-01-04T21:49:43Z,1,"Awful quality, mask is thin and doesn’t stay on and they have not responded to requests for a refund. A total scam and waste of money."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T21:46:18Z,4,Great gift and picture came out great.  A little expensive.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T21:46:00Z,5,we were very happy with our socks. My wife loved them.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T21:43:41Z,5,Exactly the gift I was looking for. Thank you she cried when she got them she loved them so much.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T21:42:02Z,1,Before placing an order do some research. This company has an F rating with the BBB. Almost every person gets nothing or someone else's order. I cannot say how bad the quality is because I never received my order. I can read other reviews and say the quality is absolute garbage. PayPal did get me a full refund. It was easy pupsocks did not even respond so I won and received all my money back around a week after placing the order. Check there Facebook page to read reviews. Read fast because they delete all but the positive reviews.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T21:40:12Z,5,"Had a problem with delivery - package was empty. Upon contacting Pupsocks to reorder as it was a gift, they immediately resubmitted my order at no charge. This company takes care of their customers."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T21:38:50Z,3,It’s cool to get images on socks. But I was disappointed in the quality of the sock. There is no extra space designed for your heel making the sock uncomfortable to wear.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T21:38:43Z,5,"I ordered this for a Christmas gift. Due to unforeseen issues, I just got the mask today. The gift is exactly what I wanted. Just took forever to get."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T21:38:03Z,5,It turned out amazing! Thank you for helping me send such a thoughtful gift!
PupSocks,2021-01-04T21:36:27Z,5,Beautiful pair of socks ! My daughter thought it was her best gift ever. Loved her elderly dog's picture on them.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T21:35:50Z,5,My family thought this was the best gift for Christmas. Milo was so thoughtful to think of us. It’s great to give personalized gifts. I did have a hard time editing my cart....but that could just be me after wine.Plus I wish the socks were made in USA.Hope u have a great future.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T21:35:14Z,1,Ordered over a Month ago and still haven’t received anything. Very disappointed to say the least. Told when I ordered it would arrive for Christmas. It was a gift. January 4 th and still nothing. Will not order from them again
PupSocks,2021-01-04T21:31:11Z,3,Socks look great. The issue I had was they don’t fit around the heal.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T21:25:47Z,2,"I was so excited for this product and had planned to order a lot more. However, I ordered on 11/30/20 and have yet to receive my product. I am unsure if this is a pupsock issue or a mail issue. Very sad as this was a Christmas present."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T21:25:16Z,1,I have not received my two pairs of socks that I have ordered. I wouldn't think it is a great customers service to ask for a review before I have even received the product. As far as I can tell it hasn't even been shipped yet.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T21:24:50Z,3,The finished product was very nice but it took way too long to deliver even with Covid and the holidays .  I also received 2 blankets in Seperate orders .  Every time I send an e mail to make sure I don't get charged twice I get a canned robot response .
PupSocks,2021-01-04T21:21:44Z,1,"I didn't got my package, and USPS tracking code says the label is created but not yet in system. It suppose to be christmas gift. I don't even if I will ever got my package."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T21:21:11Z,1,Still haven’t received my product or a response to my inquiry asking about my order. Can’t find a phone number to call either. I guess the next step is to dispute the charges on my card
PupSocks,2021-01-04T21:20:05Z,1,I never received my socks! It's been a very long time. Is there any way to look into what happened?
PupSocks,2021-01-04T21:10:58Z,5,"Great product, in time for Christmas 👍"
PupSocks,2021-01-04T21:06:35Z,5,Company did good but I am still waiting for my order to arrive. Placed my order in late November and its is January now and my order has still not arrived. Pupsocks was very nice to send me an email including what my order would look like so that I could show the person I was gifting my pupsocks to
PupSocks,2021-01-04T21:03:39Z,1,Didn’t not receive 3 weeks after ordered.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T21:02:29Z,2,"I initially received an empty mailer, when trying to contact the company several times I got no response. Only after opening a dispute with my credit card company did they respond and sent me a replacement. The quality of the image was great, however, the quality of the materials was disappointing. I would definitely not order again."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T20:57:42Z,5,"When we got our socks and they were someone else's dogs. I got a hold of the company and they took care of it and re-sent the correct socks. Mistakes happen, it is how it is handled that is important. Nice job"
PupSocks,2021-01-04T20:56:48Z,3,"Product is good, fun, novel.Delivery time was awful. Took six weeks to arrive."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T20:48:31Z,5,I purchased a pair of cat socks for a gift in purple.  I am sure this person will love these as she loves purple and sure loves her cats!
PupSocks,2021-01-04T20:46:45Z,4,Ordered these for Christmas for my sisters and parents!! They turned out great! We all love them. Even my sisters that don’t have dogs - I put their children on them.  I had a delay in my order and received an email that was perfect !  It was a mock-up with a picture to show my sister since it was delayed!  The quality of the socks are Alittle strange but comfy and pics are awesome !
PupSocks,2021-01-04T20:44:58Z,1,Still haven't received a month after ordering. Ridiculous. Avoid at all costs.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T20:44:58Z,1,Never received my order. Still waiting. Ordered Socks on December 4 and today is January 4. Received a generic email explaining they are behind on their orders. Pretty bad Customer Service.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T20:44:25Z,1,This is not what I ordered! Some other dogs face is on it!
PupSocks,2021-01-04T20:42:31Z,5,Excellent quality and such a fun gift!
PupSocks,2021-01-04T20:37:48Z,1,"I ordered masks on November 23rd and still don’t have them. I stopped getting updates on December 27th. I live in Tennessee and they were shipped from Atlanta, but every time they updated on usps they were shipping somewhere else. I think I deserve a refund! Vicky Tanner"
PupSocks,2021-01-04T20:33:58Z,5,Loved both the socks and mask!
PupSocks,2021-01-04T20:32:26Z,5,Came out great!
PupSocks,2021-01-04T20:31:13Z,2,"The idea of the sucks is very interesting and they make a good gift but the socks themselves are not really practical. In the back, it is too tight, and in the front, it is too wide. So Overall, you'd put a smile on someone's face with the gift but then, that will be it. Pretty expensive for what it is and there are better alternative gifts that will also last longer."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T20:30:13Z,1,"My tracking information never updated. The proof of my design is not what I requested in my notes. And worst of all, my order still hasn’t arrived despite being placed weeks before Christmas."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T20:29:34Z,5,My daughter loved her socks!! With a picture of her cat. I would highly recommend your company for personalized stuff like that.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T20:27:25Z,2,"The picture on the socks is cute, no doubt about that. However, the socks themselves are basically polyester tube socks. They are clearly a novelty item, not really worth the money."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T20:23:45Z,3,The photo quality is very good but the mask is quite thin and small. I would guess the socks are probably ok. I understand that they are very busy because of holidays but I emailed them because one mask had a strap adjuster missing. Two weeks and counting and only reply was automated reply stating they would get back to me as soon as they could.  Very disappointed as this was a gift.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T20:22:17Z,2,"Delivery took forever, well past the original promise date.  The material feels like plastic, I would not order again. I had high hopes for this product"
PupSocks,2021-01-04T20:16:09Z,5,"I ordered two pairs of kitty socks and am super happy with the quality! Placing the order was very easy, the quality of the socks is great, and they are super adorable! Shipping did take about 6 weeks (shipped to Canada), but this was not surprising given that the items were coming from the US and it was also right before holiday season. If ordering these for a gift, just give a little extra time for shipping. Thanks for the cute socks!"
PupSocks,2021-01-04T20:14:32Z,5,Absolutely loved the blanket.  The pictures looked great and the quality was outstanding.  I didn't love the socks quite as much...they were very stiff...more like dress socks.  The pictures were perfect however.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T20:14:26Z,1,I placed an order for a Christmas present for my friend in early December. We are already into the new year and I have yet to receive the product. The tracking information states that the product is sitting at the postal service. This has been the status for weeks now.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T20:11:05Z,1,Order took long that expected. Socks fit very strange as well
PupSocks,2021-01-04T20:10:20Z,1,"Received the wrong order first so I emailed customer service immediately. Took over a week of emailing multiple times to get any response. Had to change the color I originally ordered because they didn’t have it anymore, so that was another disappointment. Finally, after weeks of emails back and forth I got the correct pair I ordered. I would not recommend these."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T20:09:52Z,1,"Novelty item only.. As socks, they have got to be the worst socks we have ever put on our feet. I saw ""we"" as I bought a pair for 6 of us and every single person had to take them off within 5 minutes of wearing them."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T20:05:17Z,1,Ordered nearly 2 months ago and still haven’t received [Order #2504830]
PupSocks,2021-01-04T20:02:02Z,1,Not only did the socks not look good. But I did not receive them until January 2 when I had ordered them on December 7 and it was stated that I would receive them within 10 days of the order. Definitely overpriced and awful customer service
PupSocks,2021-01-04T20:00:07Z,5,Wonderful communication during the usps slow down. I love the items I ordered for my daughter. I loved getting proofs to show her while we waited for delivery. The blanket is so soft and cozy. Her cat is 13 now and she’s 18 and not living at home much. I wanted to capture Snowflake’s  beauty in items so that my daughter can always have something to remember her - no matter if they are together or not.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T19:59:29Z,5,I bought two pairs of socks as Christmas gifts and they were a crowd favorite! 100% would buy from this company again!
PupSocks,2021-01-04T19:55:04Z,5,"A Hit! Socks were good quality & turned out well!   Shipping was slower than anticipated, but had to do w/backup at USPS, not pupsocks folk."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T19:53:40Z,5,Exactly what I expected
PupSocks,2021-01-04T19:49:41Z,4,We love the concept
PupSocks,2021-01-04T19:48:01Z,5,"PupSocks delivered exactly as promised, the final product was as expected and was delivered in a timely way.  All of this was appreciated.  Well done."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T19:44:45Z,5,My wife loved her pup socks.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T19:44:17Z,1,"Unfortunately I am not in a position to review my Pupsocks as they haven't arrived yet, despite receiving notification almost a month ago that they had been shipped. I understand there are postal delays in the US but perhaps the company shouldn't have emphasized their amazingly fast product knowing this was the case. I also wonder whether they should continue taking orders and producing without letting customers know in advance that they can expect to receive their orders months later.... In any case, I do look forward to seeing them whenever they arrive!"
PupSocks,2021-01-04T19:43:30Z,3,Ordered my socks 3 weeks before Christmas. They were delivered Jan 2nd and thats understandable considering Covid and the holiday shipping disaster retailers faced this year however I reached out twice to customer service and they never responded to this day.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T19:39:43Z,1,"The socks are unwearable. The fabric is of poor quality and the shape of the ""sock"" is unwearable. This product looks more like a tube of material that someone sewed together to make what somewhat appears like a sock. The only difference between a small sock and a large sock is the length. They are both the same width. I would not recommend spending money on this product. A total waste of money. Also, the customer service team is unavailable when assistance is needed."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T19:38:51Z,3,Images looks so great! So many smiles. Fit of the socks was a little wonky due to printability I imagine.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T19:36:25Z,1,"I ordered for Cyber Monday and still have not received my order and its January, no status updates, or response to my two email, but you can guarantee they charged my credit card. So many complaints against this company. DO NOT ORDER."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T19:30:40Z,5,It was exactly what I asked for and my husband loves it!!
PupSocks,2021-01-04T19:30:01Z,5,The ordering experience was great and the socks are very cute!
PupSocks,2021-01-04T19:29:14Z,5,I ordered these as a gift for my son.  He lovef them!
PupSocks,2021-01-04T19:26:07Z,1,"My order took three times longer than promised and when it arrived I was appalled at the quality. Contacting customer service is a joke. One reply I received, the cs rep told me to quit wasting their time and learn how to use a tracking number. Do yourself a favor and buy somewhere else. Look at their BBB rating."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T19:26:06Z,2,"They arrived a few weeks after promised, missed the occasion I had ordered them for. When I did finally get them, they are a funky material. Slippery and not stretchy."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T19:23:04Z,1,"Bad experience for multiple reasons: 1) I didn't get a proof of the item I ordered.2) Only half of my pet's face made it on the pair of socks3) The sock itself is very uncomfortable.  Basically just a tube of fabric that doesn't fit to the foot and bunches in weird places.I thought this would be a fun stocking stuffer, but was a complete waste of $26 +shipping.  Will not be using this service again."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T19:21:41Z,1,Tracking says “shipped” but item never received. When I inquire all I can get is an auto response. No actual person available for assistance. I ordered one month ago. Still nothing.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T19:20:35Z,5,"Socks were late due to holiday mail scramble, but very much appreciated the steps taken to address."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T19:19:27Z,1,"I've tried contacting this company on numerous occasions regarding an order I placed back in November.  They sent an insincere, canned response, and offer no phone number, or communication or update regarding the shipment. They advertised the product was made in the USA and that it would arrive by Christmas.  Well, we turned a new year and still no product or communication.  If you are going to call yourself a business, invest in customer service, and maybe a business phone number!"
PupSocks,2021-01-04T19:13:17Z,5,Everyone loved them for Christmas
PupSocks,2021-01-04T19:09:36Z,2,The pictures came out well on the socks of our pup but the itchy material the sock is made from makes the product virtually unusable.  This is pretty much a gag gift.  Looks funny and kinda cool but the actual sock is not comfortable enough to actually wear.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T19:08:43Z,1,Placed order in early December for Christmas delivery Still waiting for socks Tracking site does not work
PupSocks,2021-01-04T19:08:22Z,1,I ordered 2 pairs of socks. They came in separate deliveries. The sock material is like a cheap activewear shirt. This company's email does not work. I only get error messages back. That is the contact email directly off their website. They use a different email for their spam emails..they do not respond to that either. They also took a very long time. I do not recommend these overpriced socks to anyone. Find a t-shirt printer and get them to make you socks. Will be much cheaper and higher quality.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T19:03:20Z,1,I have never received my order. I paid and I never got it.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T19:01:39Z,1,We still haven’t received them ☹️
PupSocks,2021-01-04T19:00:59Z,5,"Great product!! I ordered these for a Christmas gift and it was the best under the tree! All considering the tough time we’re in PupSocks did everything they could and I couldn’t be happier, great product!!"
PupSocks,2021-01-04T18:57:29Z,1,Terrible! I ordered on December 1st and I have still not received my order or a refund and it is January 4th. Stay away from this company.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T18:56:21Z,3,"The shipping through USPS was very delayed. The blanket was cute, but the fleece could be softer. The socks aren’t really shaped, so they are not very comfortable."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T18:55:04Z,5,Great quality and service! I’ve ordered socks a few times and a blanket and have been really happy with the product every time!
PupSocks,2021-01-04T18:54:10Z,4,"Ordered 2 masks for my adult-sized kids for Christmas. The graphics are very well done and the colors are vibrant. I feel the masks are a bit skimpy in size, could cover a little more of the face, and if they had an adjustable nosepiece, even better. I do appreciate being able to adjust the straps to fit."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T18:53:23Z,5,Great printing onto the material from the Jorge I provided. Amazing quality too. Thank you for the BEST stocking-stuffers ever.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T18:52:17Z,4,"I bought 2 pairs of socks and the design is sooo cute and would definitely get 5 stars on its own. However, the socks are just tubes that are the same width all the way down so they fit kind of weirdly (loose in some places and tight in others). I'm sure this makes it much easier to print on them but makes them feel a little awkward to wear. Overall great socks and super cute! I will definitely wear them a lot."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T18:51:05Z,5,"Great experience! The process of creating and ordering the socks was very simple, and the post-order communication was great...I always knew exactly where my order was. Everyone was thrilled to receive them! & now their friends have ordered their own socks too!"
PupSocks,2021-01-04T18:49:57Z,4,The throw is really nice and quality is good.  The picture is reproduced good but my critique would be that for our picture getting a little bit of the under the neck area would complete it nicely.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T18:49:21Z,1,"I placed my order back on December 6, 2020, on what the website loudly stated was still within the 24-hour window to have them done and shipped out by christmas.  a few days later in the 12th, I got an email with tracking data, so all looks right.  cut forward to December 23, nothing has arrived, the tracking number lists the item as in ""pre-shipment,"" and the copy sends out a set of mock-up pictures to print as a ""placeholder gift"" because of some poorly defined delays, and a coupon for 40% off anything else they offer.  it's now January 4th, and nothing has changed; the shipping info still says ""pre-shipment,"" and nothing else has been said.to be honest I wasn't terribly impressed with the cropping job shown with the mock-up photos, either.will update if/when things finally arrive."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T18:48:59Z,1,"You send me socks with the wrong picture on them, I’ve emailed and gotten no response. Never order these socks"
PupSocks,2021-01-04T18:48:40Z,5,The quality was absolutely amazing. The picture of my dog on the socks was identical to what he actually looks like. Shipping was fast. The quality of the socks is fantastic. Will definitely be telling all of my friends about this amazing gift idea!
PupSocks,2021-01-04T18:48:09Z,1,I have yet to receive my order. It has been tracking with USPS since it was shipped.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T18:46:17Z,1,"Well, I ordered on dec 6, it shipped dec 18 and I still haven’t received it on Jan 4."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T18:45:48Z,5,"Ordered as a christmas present, socks are oddly shaped and very very tight around the ankles, but a great novelty for a pet lover"
PupSocks,2021-01-04T18:40:37Z,5,Got these as a special treat for my son who enjoys novelty socks and he loves them! Fast deilvery too.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T18:40:26Z,5,BEST GIFT!!! My wife was blown away as she had no clue she was getting these. She received two pairs of socks with her favorite cat and dog on them...she was so excited! Thank you to the person who did the cropping of the animals. Cheers!
PupSocks,2021-01-04T18:40:13Z,1,The print of the dog is good but in no way are these wearable socks. They are not made of a comfortable material and are not even shaped like a foot. I bought these as a gift thinking they would be her new favorite socks and the reality is she will not wear these even one time.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T18:39:48Z,1,Still haven’t received the socks. Ordered a few weeks ago.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T18:38:56Z,1,Poor quality and shipped and received weeks after order date. Wanted to love giving this gift but no.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T18:34:37Z,2,"I ordered these for a Christmas present but when they arrived I was not impressed. The imagery was great, but that was about all. The sock itself was shaped as a rectangle. It looked more like a slab of fabric than a sock. There were seams on the outer sides of the sock and the toes were straight. The width of the foot and ankle portion were identical, both far too large for a size M. Highly dissatisfied considering the cost of the product."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T18:28:07Z,5,"I ordered socks for my entire family for Christmas, with photos of our cat and our dog on each pair. Great quality, the animal faces were perfect! They were a huge hit with everyone."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T18:27:39Z,1,Terrible sizing and material. Tried to contact the seller and won’t answer any of my questions. Would give a negative star if possible.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T18:27:27Z,4,I love these socks! I ordered a pair for my dad with his dog’s face on them and I was very happy with the result. Shipping did take a while and my only other critique is that my dad is normally a size 12 in men’s shoes and I ordered an XL in the socks which is a size 13-15 and the socks still fit him very tight. I definitely recommend ordering a size up. Other than that I’m happy with my purchase
PupSocks,2021-01-04T18:24:59Z,1,The quality of these socks are terrible. They are not a sock material. They are some weird non conforming material. They are huge with no formation of a sock. I would not buy these again.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T18:21:17Z,4,The socks looked great but my 8 year old didn’t like the feel of the sock material.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T18:21:03Z,1,"I would give Pup Socks zero stars if it were an option. The experience has been a complete disappointment. I ordered two pair of Custom Holiday Socks on December 7 and still have not received my order. They were intended to be part of a Christmas present for my wife. On December 24th I received an email with a mock-up of what the socks would look like. Pro tip: A really lame photoshop job is not the best answer for poor service. Now the holidays have come and gone and still no socks. A full refund would be the best course of action at this point, but I'm sure that's not going to happen."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T18:17:30Z,5,Awesome and so cute!I got these as a gift for my friend and they came out super well!
PupSocks,2021-01-04T18:17:14Z,5,My pup mask was perfect.  They were able to just crop her adorable face and make the most amazing mask for my son.  He loved it.  It was done quickly and got delivered more quickly than I expected.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T18:13:24Z,1,"I placed an order at the end of November, and as of today, January 4th, have not received the socks. I have reached out to customer service and have not received any replies from them whatsoever. I am still excited for the socks, but will not be ordering again due to the extreme delay and lack of communication in the sock order."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T18:13:21Z,3,"The socks were cute. My husband now has two pairs -a pair for each of our cat's face. The printing quality is great and the pictures of our cats are great. But upon opening, I was disappointed with the quality of the sock themselves. They are of a slick, stretchy material -much like underwear or yoga pants. These are novelty socks, not socks to wear throughout a day."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T18:12:37Z,5,These cute socks were an awesome Christmas gift. They arrived in plenty of time and my friend loved them!
PupSocks,2021-01-04T18:12:19Z,5,"They came out perfect! Did four different faces of my dog and they were cropped perfectly and the receiver absolutely loved their gift!Highly recommend, definitely worth the money."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T18:08:13Z,2,"I was very disappointed that the blanket did not come until after Christmas when the website said it would be processed immediately. I also had tried to order a blue blanket, but it was white when it arrived."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T18:05:39Z,1,I placed my order on November 30 and today January 4th and it’s still not arrived and little communication about how much longer we may have to wait.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T18:04:39Z,3,The quality of the print was great but the socks are square toed and not very comfortable
PupSocks,2021-01-04T18:04:01Z,1,Never received our pup-socks and due to high volume haven’t heard back on how we can move forward.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T18:00:18Z,1,I placed an order back in November for Christmas and I still haven't received it and it's now January 4th. Very disappointed.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T17:58:43Z,3,"I absolutely love my blanket!!  Only reason I gave it three stars was because it took forever to get to me - company needs to work on shipping, otherwise beautiful quality"
PupSocks,2021-01-04T17:58:30Z,5,"Though it did arrive late, the blanket I ordered was as expected. Gift recipient loved it."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T17:57:59Z,1,Ordered 2 blankets on November 27th. Still have not received product.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T17:56:13Z,3,"I got the socks and they did have my dogs incredibly cute face on them, but the material these socks are made of is extremely poor quality.  I got them for my boyfriend, but he'll never wear them.  It's such a weird and uncomfortable material."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T17:54:45Z,5,This company is amazing. They go above and beyond for customer service! Socks were so adorable also!
PupSocks,2021-01-04T17:54:31Z,1,I placed my order weeks and weeks ago as a Christmas gift and was charged for the order. I have never received my order and will need to submit a dispute with PayPal.    Very disappointing.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T17:53:05Z,5,These socks are incredibly adorable and my boyfriend loved his. A beloved keep sake of his dog who is no longer with us. Pictures are clear and fabric is soft. Even with covid they arrived in a decent time frame.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T17:50:07Z,1,I have ordered these before and have been pleased but I have not received the two pairs I ordered for Christmas yet and cannot get a reply to my emails. I placed my order November 23 and it was mailed on December 4. There is no tracking information after December 6 and I would appreciate you checking in this and refunding my money if they are lost. I can’t get any other information from USPS.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T17:49:37Z,1,"It's been one month, don't have what we ordered, have reached out every way possible with no response. Would never order from them again, and will be calling the cc company for a refund. What a joke."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T17:49:31Z,5,What a beautiful gift these socks make! Highly recommend.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T17:41:36Z,1,too large and a much too uncomfortable size (not shaped) and fabric (almost like a hard polyester). wouldn’t recommend.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T17:40:27Z,2,"I was extremely happy with the image on the underwear I purchased previously, but this time I got a blanket using the same face and it was so dark you couldn't see the features.  Not sure why unless it was a more experienced person that did the design the first time."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T17:39:58Z,5,Bought a pair for my son.  He loved them.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T17:39:28Z,3,"Funny but VERY cheaply made. The socks took weeks to arrive, however, in the meantime, I did receive notification from the company and even a sample of what they are going to look like once made"
PupSocks,2021-01-04T17:39:09Z,5,Such a great gift!  Family loved the masks and socks ! Beautifully done!
PupSocks,2021-01-04T17:38:33Z,5,"Perfect!Affordable, adorable, and the perfect gift!Thank you, PupSocks!"
PupSocks,2021-01-04T17:37:11Z,1,"I have not received my order even though I placed it on December 6, which should have been plenty of time to receive for Christmas based on the company’s promised delivery schedule. I sent two emails to customer service that were ignored. I did get two pithy generic emails in response about general delivery delays, blaming the post office,  but never heard anything about my specific order. How about a mea culpa folks? Then I got a tracking notice that the socks had maybe left the building on December 22-which means they were mailed at the earliest in the 22nd. So you cannot blame the post office if you didn’t complete production until three days before Christmas.I understand this has been a difficult year in many levels but once you knew the gifts would not get here by Christmas you should have immediately notified your customers. And not responding to two emails to customer service is unforgivable."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T17:37:05Z,5,Love the socks!  Was a great gift!!
PupSocks,2021-01-04T17:36:32Z,2,"The pictures came out very cute, but the socks are terrible. I didn’t know I was getting a tube sock that is way too big even though I ordered the correct size and tried to shrink them multiple times. Wouldn’t order again."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T17:36:29Z,2,"Over six weeks, still no item. I understand you can’t control mailing via USPS but this is sort of ridiculous. Also, not much communication or an apology. I’m sure it’s been tough on your business but still, customers first."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T17:34:57Z,1,After waiting a month and a half for my socks you sent me the wrong socks... not my pet.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T17:34:33Z,5,I bought a pair of blue socks with our son’s grumpy cat face on them as a Christmas gift. He said it was the best pair of socks he ever got and wore them the next day!
PupSocks,2021-01-04T17:34:24Z,4,"I love the sox and the masks that I ordered.My only disappointment was a delay in shipping that missed christmas - came about a week later.I was notified of the delay, but disappointed  by the timing.The products are great and would recommend this company."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T17:33:15Z,1,Cheaply made products! The elastic on the mask was already so stretched out it doesn’t fit anyone! Will never order from here again or recommend! Overpriced and cheap materials used for socks and mask! Terrible! Highly disappointed!!!
PupSocks,2021-01-04T17:32:22Z,5,Socks were perfect! Great quality and the photos was spot on! Thank You!
PupSocks,2021-01-04T17:31:36Z,4,"I placed my order on December 6 and production began promptly on December 7.  With shipping, a 10-business day turnaround meant that my product would arrive by 12-21, plenty of time before Christmas.  It turns out the product wasn’t shipped till ~December 22/23 and didn’t arrive till December 30.  I understand the Christmas rush and I really thought the few extra days of cushion was enough time to allow for that.  Apparently not. I do feel that USPS was just as much at fault for the late shipment as it was DAYS before it finally departed the initial shipping center.  Having said all that, the socks look FANTASTIC!  Y’all did an outstanding job with them!  My daughter absolutely loves them!!   I guess next time I order, I’ll do it a bit earlier."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T17:31:30Z,5,The whole process was great! Highly recommend PupSocks to anyone looking for a novelty gift.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T17:31:24Z,4,Love the size of the blanket...would give it 5 but one of the faces of my dog came out very blue in tone that it almost looks smudged. Other than that great for gifts.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T17:30:22Z,1,"Ordered mid- November for Xmas, still haven’t received. One very disappointed child.Emailed customer service before Xmas and got a generic email saying they were suffering delays at the hands of USPS.No updates since, but plenty of irritating ‘Special Offer’ emails still being sent out, and requests for reviews. So here it is.Very, very disappointing."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T17:27:48Z,5,Quick turn around and the images on the socks were very nicely done. Great Christmas present.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T17:27:23Z,1,"Ordered on 5th December...still nothing received on 4th Jan. No response to emails, just an automated ‘we are overwhelmed by orders’ b*##s+}] if they cannot fulfil orders they should not accept them. Absolutely appalling."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T17:24:02Z,5,LOVED the two different pairs I got for my family members.  And they loved them too!!  Great job!!
PupSocks,2021-01-04T17:22:08Z,5,Great experience! PupSocks did a great job with the socks I ordered. My sister loved them. :)
PupSocks,2021-01-04T17:21:28Z,2,Ordered a pair of socks with the faces of two cats and included one photo with both cats with clear faces.  Socks delivered with only one of the cats.  This was a Christmas present too so it came with this explanation.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T17:21:25Z,1,"Incredibly disappointed in the quality of these socks. The material is very strange and uncomfortable. The sizing is also way too big and does not fit an average-sized foot whatsoever. I also asked for my delivery address to be changed, received confirmation and they were still delivered to the wrong place. Very unhappy."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T17:20:23Z,5,"Bought the socks as part of a Christmas gift for my Mother that loves her pup. She was over the moon for these. They were good quality and they did a great job of cutting out the face. Very happy with my purchase. The only thing I thought I should mention, if you are trying to keep your purchase a surprise you better get the mail, as these are sent in a package that has their logo and pupsocks all over the envelope. Not an issue for me, but could be for some."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T17:20:08Z,2,"Sock quality is lacking and very uncomfortable. A novelty idea, but an expensive one at that. Wouldn’t recommend and certainly won’t reorder."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T17:19:58Z,1,I haven’t received my order - I ordered on 12/6. Cyber Monday sale - my order wasn’t shipped until 12/23 when I emailed . You didn’t even respond directly to me. My order had an invalid tracking ID sent to me on 12/12. I’m very disappointed in your customer service . I even asked for a refund and no response.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T17:18:24Z,1,Slow shipping.. Ordered first week of December for a Christmas gift. It is now the first week in January and product has not arrived. 4 weeks later when shipping said it would arrive by Christmas.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T17:18:23Z,2,"The pup socks I ordered as a Christmas gift for my husband arrived today, and I must say I’m disappointed. The image of my pet on the socks turned out great. The sock quality, on the other hand, is very disappointing. The material feels plasticy, and the fit is very strange. The socks are tight in some places yet super bunchy on the top of the foot. Sadly, I don’t feel like these socks can be worn comfortably making them feel like a waste of money. I hope pup socks can improve the quality of their socks because they would have been a great gift if quality had been better."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T17:17:55Z,1,I love the idea and the images as really cute but the socks are pretty much unwearable. The fabric is very odd and they don't even conform to the shape of a foot. The toes are oddly wide and the fabric is not shaped at the ankle so it bunch at the top of the foot. Overall I am quite disappointed and they were not cheap.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T17:15:14Z,1,"Sat on my order for weeks. Shipped snail mail instead of expediting after sitting on it for weeks. Arrived late and was lost so even later. I emailed three times, I received canned responses and no real response. First shipment finally arrived and was missing 3 out of the four items ordered. Just terrible. Will NEVER order again. Customer service is horrible."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T17:13:27Z,1,It took over a month for the order to arrive and that was after they allegedly sent the item twice. Then when it did arrive it was not my order. I received someone else’s. I’ve emailed the company and have received no response. Giving it another day before contacting my credit card company to have the charge reversed. Horrible company!!
PupSocks,2021-01-04T17:12:55Z,5,They were exactly what the site looks like!
PupSocks,2021-01-04T17:12:44Z,2,"There was not any communication from the seller, despite multiple attempts to contact.  I realize I hit the holiday rush... but that's something a business needs to prepare for and not pass on the liability to the consumer.  The product was OK, but definitely fell short of my expectations in quality, delivery time, and communication."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T17:10:51Z,1,My order was printed incorrectly. I have emailed multiple times to get this fixed with no response. Very disappointed I can get no response. This was a Christmas gift for a little girl and she is so sad about it.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T17:10:41Z,5,Ordering process was easy and I love the products we received!
PupSocks,2021-01-04T17:10:26Z,5,"Super fun gift for my Son-in-Law, he loved it!"
PupSocks,2021-01-04T17:09:36Z,1,"The socks arrived one day before Christmas Eve which ended up being over a week late.  My biggest complaint is the quality of the socks, they are horrible, not comfortable at all.  I ended up paying a lot for these and am very disappointed."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T17:07:26Z,1,"Can give it more then one star due to not receiving my order.  I’ve email the support multiple times but get a generic email saying COVID has caused problems, when my problem when tracked is that it’s in my country but now lost!!  If someone ever  wants to help please contact me"
PupSocks,2021-01-04T17:06:34Z,1,I ordered my socks a month ago and have received no updates on when they will arrive. This is the second time I’ve experienced extremely slow shipping from pupsocks. Will not be utilizing this company ever again.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T17:05:36Z,2,"The designer did a great job adding our cat's face to the socks. However, I wasn't expecting the socks to be a tube without a formed heel. They're almost like a compression sock. Because of the shape, the sock bunches up in front of the ankle. With certain shoes these would be unwearable. My husband thought they were hilarious, but he won't be able to wear them much."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T17:05:10Z,1,Never received my order and had no communication from anyone about this.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T17:05:02Z,1,I ordered these socks on 12/6/2020 for my son who was visiting from another state for Christmas.  I tried tracking their shipment and was unable to find them or get updates.  I reached out to Pupsocks twice and got an auto-generated email saying how busy they were and to be patient.  The socks were supposed to be a Christmas gift.  They did not arrive before Christmas.  My son went back home.  I tried reaching out again to Pupsocks again for a refund but got the same auto message.  The socks arrived on 1/3/2021 and they are the worst quality I have felt.  I would not put my feet into these uncomfortable socks.  I again reached out to Pupsocks for a refund.  I want to mail them back but of course they don't come with a return form.  Terrible quality and terrible customer service.  Do not buy from PupSocks!
PupSocks,2021-01-04T17:04:12Z,2,"The sock has a very weird cut, it doesn't fit well on any foot. The fabric is also strange and not very comfortable. The print was nice though."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T17:03:34Z,4,A really fun Christmas gift - ordering and uploading the photo was seamless.  Socks are printed well but not the most comfy socks by any means.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T17:03:06Z,2,The sock quality is poor.  It's not in the shape of a sock.  It is just a long tube of material.  Cannot be worn on the foot comfortably
PupSocks,2021-01-04T17:02:30Z,1,My package arrived empty. I’ve emailed 3 times and have yet to hear back from anyone. I DO NOT recommend this business.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T17:02:09Z,1,Very disappointed I didn’t receive my order for Christmas. I placed my order on 11/23/20 and still have yet to receive it. The only thing that was helpful was that they sent me a mock up of what my order was going to look like so I was able to print them out and place them in envelopes for the gifts.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T17:01:58Z,5,"Love these socks!I got multiple pairs for family, friends and my boss for Christmas with all their animals on them and everyone loved them!The only thing people seemed to say was they were tight, even though I got the right size. But in general, they were so cute and are great for gifts for loved ones!"
PupSocks,2021-01-04T17:01:56Z,5,The socks came out amazing! Absolutely adorable and better than expected.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T17:00:51Z,1,"The picture did not show up well at all. As there is no way to preview, I was just stuck with the product."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T17:00:03Z,4,"They didn't turn out exactly as I expected.  The picture I had seen showed various sizes of the animal faces for a litle more variety than what we actually got.  However, our daughter still really loves them!!!We were disappointed in the time taken to get the order. I ordered the socks on December 3, 2020.  We did not get them until January 2, 2021.  We printed the picture that was sent to us and gave it to her for Christmas."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T16:59:54Z,3,"The socks took a really long time to arrive - likely due to Covid and post office, so not a bit deal! The dog picture I added looked great! When I gave the socks to my boyfriend the feed back was that the socks fit really strange. They seem to be just like long tubes not really sock shape, right around the ankles. The socks didn’t seem the best quality and didn’t really seem to be similar to sock shape and was a strange material."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T16:59:39Z,5,I love them!  They are really awesome and the quality of the picture is really good.  My husband loved them when he opened them for Christmas.   Highly recommend!
PupSocks,2021-01-04T16:59:16Z,4,"Socks came out looking great. Shipping was delayed, however, i have a feeling that was related to the USPS."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T16:59:07Z,4,The socks were so late. Understandable because of Xmas and Covid. They will now make a great bday present instead!Thanks!
PupSocks,2021-01-04T16:58:53Z,5,I ordered 3 blankets for my kids for Christmas. Even though we did not get them for Christmas we did get an email from PupSocks apologizing for the Delay and making a card that we could print out to give. They did come the day after Christmas and the kids love them. They are so soft and love that their animals faces are on them.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T16:58:53Z,1,I never received my order. I am very disappointed...
PupSocks,2021-01-04T16:58:38Z,2,Took way too long. I ordered in November. It’s January and they’re still not here.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T16:56:06Z,2,These socks were super cute...BUT my 13yr old daughter can not even get them on. They are like compression socks. She would have worn them everyday but now they are truly a novelty to show people. To expensive to not be able to actually wear. Disappointed
PupSocks,2021-01-04T16:55:33Z,5,Ordered 2 blankets and they came quick and they are so cute!  Customer service was also very responsive!
PupSocks,2021-01-04T16:55:07Z,5,"The socks and blanket were puuurrrrfect! They were a gift and the receiver of the gift loved it. Yes, shipping got delayed but that was out of the company’s control. So they sent a mock up which was great! Thank you so much!"
PupSocks,2021-01-04T16:54:52Z,5,Quality is fantastic and would buy again! Great overall experience.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T16:54:15Z,5,We loved out PupSocks!  You just have to remember to send in a good head-shot of your pet.  I will order again!  Thanks so much!!Alice
PupSocks,2021-01-04T16:54:00Z,2,I haven’t received my socks yet. I ordered them so long ago. Tracking information has not been updated for 3 weeks. I’m hopeful they will show up and I can give another review.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T16:51:55Z,1,Would love to give a true review but after over a month I still have not received my order. Just an email of the mock up. Will update my review if my purchase ever shows up.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T16:50:30Z,5,It was awesome! The quality was sooo much better than I expected. I honestly didn’t have a great picture for them to use and they exceeded my expectations. I highly recommend.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T16:49:41Z,5,"The quality of the blanket was amazing, far surpassed all my expectations!!"
PupSocks,2021-01-04T16:48:22Z,2,The pictures turned out good on the socks but the socks are very poor quality. The toes are not tapered at all so you are left with a ton of extra material that balls up in your shoe. My girlfriend was thrilled with the look but unfortunately can not wear them. I tried them on asi have bigger feet but ran into the same issue.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T16:48:07Z,1,I sent many emails regarding the photos to be used on the blanket . Those emails were never addressed 1 photo is missing on the blanket that I really wanted to be included Will not be referring you to anyone
PupSocks,2021-01-04T16:45:49Z,5,"I ordered a blanket with pictures of our 2 cats for my daughter for Christmas. It was a couple of days late, but the company did a great job of keeping me updated on my order and they even sent a mock-up of the blanket for me to print and share with her while we waited. The blanket looks great and my daughter loves it!"
PupSocks,2021-01-04T16:45:22Z,1,Ordered in plenty of time for Christmas (mid- November).  They still haven’t arrived. Sent a message to customer service and only received an auto reply.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T16:43:08Z,5,My daughter loved her blanket I got her for Christmas.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T16:42:40Z,3,Very cute. Took a bit longer then I expected but considering the holidays. Wish the socks itself were a bit softer. But I guess being there’s photos on them they have to use a certain material. I would size up when ordering
PupSocks,2021-01-04T16:39:40Z,1,Your design team did not listen to the instruction and it was suppose to be socks not a face mask.Joe
PupSocks,2021-01-04T16:39:24Z,5,"Love them, these are just grand!! Definitely will order again bought these for my niece with her favorite (mind you only ) cat she adores them."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T16:38:36Z,1,I have contacted the company multiple times via multiple platforms about a problem with the order and it has been over two weeks without a response. Simply unacceptable all around. I would not recommend this to my worst enemies.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T16:38:07Z,1,"Order socks well before the holidays. Order was completed and set with company until just before Christmas when they decided to ship it out.  Arrived one week after Christmas.  Had to get new present for Christmas.  Will not purchase or recommend to anyone.  They have been having shipping problems well before Covid and the holidays, prior to 2018"
PupSocks,2021-01-04T16:37:27Z,3,"Took a month to receive my socks and so it missed the Christmas holiday but in the end, the socks were received and quality is good."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T16:35:48Z,1,One star for me ordering well in advance of the holiday rush and still receiving after Christmas.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T16:34:47Z,3,Customer service is not great. Have contacted them with an email & did not receive a response back. Could not find order so placed another order & have not received the last order.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T16:27:05Z,5,"Fun product, accurate clear pictures."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T16:24:24Z,5,Great quality blanket. Our dog’s photo was cropped perfectly and the blanket is super soft. I’m very happy with this purchase and so are my kids!
PupSocks,2021-01-04T16:24:19Z,1,"I still have not received my order (purchased 12/02) and when I reached out to customer support (after finding an email that was actually valid), I got an automatic and pretty unprofessional email from the unnamed CEO talking poorly of USPS and completely passing the blame off on them. According to my tracking information, my package hasn't even been picked up by the USPS yet so shouldn't PupSocks have more information? I give people the benefit of the doubt but when all of my other packages arrive only slightly delayed through the USPS, I wouldn't be so quick to pass the buck entirely off to them. I am not hard to please and understand delays during the holidays but I am shocked by my experience with this company. If I did more research beforehand and saw the amount of negative reviews on BBB, I would not have supported."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T16:23:46Z,4,"Only 4 stars because they didn't make it in time for Christmas even though I ordered on 12/7.  They really made me happy when I awoke on Christmas Eve to an email presentation of each pair that I ordered so I could at least present to everyone on Christmas Day.  They finally delivered, but now I have to ship them to everyone. They are super cute.  The grandbabies socks were way too big."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T16:21:16Z,1,"Horrible lag time between order submission and delivery.Ordered on December 7th, 2020 and item wasn't delivered until December 30th.   Will not use or recommend PupSocks."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T16:19:06Z,5,They did a fantastic job with the four images of four dogs that I submitted. It was clearly done with care and individual attention to make the pictures work. Extremely impressed.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T16:18:02Z,1,My order still has not arrived but I’ve been charged for it. Zero communication from company and I ordered I 8 weeks ago.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T16:05:55Z,5,"My wife was delighted with her new kitty socks, and I was also delighted with the communication and delivery process."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T16:04:18Z,1,Made an order on nov 27 for 1 pair of socks.  Tried to get an update on my order however get the same email as everyone else that there is an issue with shipping.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T16:02:42Z,5,"Love how pupsocks for my husband turned out! The material is smooth and feels like it will last without giving you sweaty feet. I appreciated the mock up that they sent out when xmas shipping was delayed, I know it was a hard year for usps and it was super fun to show him what was coming and find out that he bought me the same thing in another color lol 10/10 would recommend!"
PupSocks,2021-01-04T16:02:26Z,1,only one star not due to quality of the so (as i still have not received any product yet) but due to the complete lack of customer service when i contacted you twice about this order.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T15:56:14Z,5,"Socks were just as I expected. The editing of the photos, as I had two faces that were put on them, was far better that what I had been thinking. Got many laughs and approval during the holidays, as they were a present. Even the individual who received them has worn them multiple times, despite not being a fan of socks with any sort of fun coloring/design on them."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T15:50:17Z,1,"Very disappointed! I ordered a gift on December 4th, 2020 and here we are Jan 4th, 2021 and I still don't have the Christmas gift for my boss. Christmas has passed and I was not able to give my gift. I'm so humiliated because I had to show him an email of his gift. It states that is only take 10 business days and while I understand that it was the holiday rush that still gave us enough time to get it here before Christmas BUT it still isn't here. Very bad impression for a first time customer and I doubt I will ever buy from your company again."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T15:38:26Z,1,Package was received empty. I've contacted the company but I have yet to get a response about a reshipment or a refund
PupSocks,2021-01-04T15:38:16Z,5,"The socks turned out nicely and are of good quality. It was nice to be able to have custom images on them. Given the circumstances, the turnaround for receiving them was awesome."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T15:37:32Z,5,I ordered a blanket and socks for my niece with her dog on them. I love both of them. The blanket is super soft and seriously a great quality blanket. The shipping did take longer than expected which was because of USPS and not because of PupSocks but even though it wasn't their fault they sent me an email with a mockup of what the blanket and socks would look like so I could print it off and give to the person receiving it. They also sent me a coupon for a future purchase. I thought that was great! They also emailed me after I did finally receive the package to check in and make sure I got it. Great customer service!! I highly recommend PupSocks!
PupSocks,2021-01-04T15:36:32Z,1,"Ordered in early December and still have not received items. Sent email and took a long time for a response and it was very generic. When I do get them,  I hope they are good quality."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T15:34:02Z,5,"This was absolutely my husband’s favorite of his Christmas gifts!  He loves our pups so much and he's a fan of wacky socks, so these were perfect!"
PupSocks,2021-01-04T15:32:24Z,1,Ordered on 12/6 and shipping label created on 12/12. sent company dozens of messages with zero response except a generic response blaming covid for their horrible customer service. No other company I ordered from had any issues getting me my orders on time. It's been a month and they cant' even respond!!! Really???? NEVER AGAIN
PupSocks,2021-01-04T15:29:06Z,1,I still have not received my order.  I ordered on 12/05/2020 and still have not received the socks.  I would like to give a better review if I actually receive them.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T15:29:03Z,1,"I ordered my socks on the beginning of December. I received an email that they were shipping on the 13th. Today is Jan 4 and I still have not gotten my socks! I planned to order a blanket, but not now!!"
PupSocks,2021-01-04T15:28:50Z,1,It’s been over a month and still haven’t gotten them. Don’t know if this is a scam.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T15:27:49Z,5,Loved both blankets!!
PupSocks,2021-01-04T15:26:22Z,3,"The quality of the socks were great, but the way my dogs face was cropped, the whole bottom of his face was cut off."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T15:26:04Z,3,"Ordered a blanket and socks. The blanket is wonderful, vibrant, soft. The socks- HORRIBLE> I ordered men's socks for my 9 year old and we could not get his feet in them. They are horribly cut and designed."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T15:24:03Z,5,The socks look amazing! Very seemless process. Will for sure be ordering from them again
PupSocks,2021-01-04T15:23:46Z,1,I still have not received my order!
PupSocks,2021-01-04T15:16:56Z,1,"I ordered my socks in November, got a notification of shipping in early December but when I contacted the shipping company they said they have not received the order to ship it yet. I have requested a refund twice and have only received generic, auto generated messages back. The company states there are issues with USPS but my tracking number is not a USPS number. I believe that this is a fraudulent company and will be continuing to seek a refund."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T15:13:23Z,3,"The design printed on the socks were great. Whoever cut out the pet pics did a nice job on all 3 of my sock styles. The socks themselves were just ok. Although there was a heel and toe area printed on the fabric, they were not sock shaped, just a tube of fabric with the printing on them. Same diameter from toe to calf, not very comfortable. Fun for holiday gift but not practical to actually wear for a workday."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T15:05:03Z,1,Terrible customer service. I received a shipping notice on 12/12 and absolutely nothing since - no updates and no product. Multiple attempts to get in touch with someone in customer service have been ignored. Obviously the items were not received by Christmas as promised and looking like I won’t receive them at all. Very disappointing
PupSocks,2021-01-04T14:50:05Z,1,"It's been almost a month and I have yet to receive my order. Unfortunately, it was a Christmas gift and there's no update the company can provide other than ""USPS is experiencing delays"", however, I've received SEVERAL other orders from USPS from other companies and they've had no issues in fulfilling my orders.  If the order is not received within the next week or so, I'll be disputing the charge as this is just unacceptable."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T14:47:59Z,3,"We really the blanket, the print quality is very good. I am giving a low review because I ordered it in early November as a Christmas gift and it did not arrive until the week after Christmas. I understand shipping delays due to the pandemic, but almost 7 weeks seems a bit excessive."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T14:45:50Z,4,"The socks are really cute, but the delivery was much later than expected, and when I reached out to customer service I did not receive a response for over a week."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T14:30:04Z,1,"I'm very upset over the situation with the shipping that was experienced with my order.  My order for a pair of socks was placed in early December for a Christmas present.  And at no point during the ordering process was I informed that I should expect these to be delivered AFTER Christmas.  The tracking number I was provided by your company showed a scheduled delivery of December 26th!  I understand that what occurs during shipping is out of your hands.  But from your email response to my concern / complaint, you knew that USPS was experiencing delays from past orders, yet you continued to use them!!  Why not ship through UPS or FedEx?!  To make matters worse, you knew of the delays with USPS and still shipped my order via ground service (no expedite or priority!!).  Also, I received many shipments from other e-commerce businesses during the holidays, and experienced no issues with them using USPS.  Ultimately I hold your company responsible for this.  This is not good business, and you have terrible customer service."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T14:29:04Z,3,"Super cute, however, the backside of one sock came out quite blurry, the others are all find and the same image."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T14:22:35Z,5,The socks turned out so cute and were very comfortable. My niece was so excited to get them.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T14:20:24Z,1,Socks fit poorly and are an odd material.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T14:18:52Z,1,I received what I thought was my order well before Christmas but low and behold when I open the package it is someone else's dog on my socks. I have tried to contact the company to straighten it out but have not gotten any responses.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T14:13:18Z,1,"Ordered in November expecting delivery well before Christmas. They took weeks to reply to my email blaming Covid for delays with shipping. I finally received my order today, when I opened it, the socks have a photo of a dog on it, we ordered for a cat!! I have asked for a refund. No doubt they will take weeks to get back to me. EDIT: 8 days after emailing I still haven't had a response."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T14:01:44Z,1,"Have not received them yet, shipment significantly delayed."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T13:53:30Z,1,Haven’t received them yet. Ordered a month ago.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T13:52:07Z,1,"I ordered on Dec. 8, 2020, it is now Jan. 4 2021 and i still have not received my order."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T13:48:14Z,1,Unfortunately I never received my order. I am going to request a refund. The tracking information provided has not been updated since end of Nov. Disappointed.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T13:48:13Z,5,These are the cutest! Love these socks with our pups on it!
PupSocks,2021-01-04T13:24:09Z,5,Perfect Customization!!!The custom socks and blanket of our pup's face came out great!!!  Highly recommend!!!
PupSocks,2021-01-04T13:23:02Z,1,"Very disappointed in the quality of the socks and service of the company.  I ordered 5 pairs for Christmas presents 4 weeks before Christmas.  I didn’t get a mock up for review until Christmas Eve which I didn’t see until after Christmas because I was way too busy with it being Christmas Eve to even think about email.  The socks arrived another week later with no input from me.  I ordered red socks shown in several pics in the site, but they sent me orange saying they couldn’t accommodate red.  One of the pics turned out terrible, but I wasn’t able to request a different pic.  I emailed a complaint regarding all of this and no resolution attempted whatsoever.  Very disappointing experience.  Lesson learned.  Don’t make the same mistake I did."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T13:08:43Z,1,Haven’t received my order. It’s been almost a month
PupSocks,2021-01-04T13:06:43Z,1,Ordered the xl mens (13-15). They were so tight it was impossible to get them on a size 13. Waste of money.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T12:59:15Z,5,"I was extremely impressed on how the socks turned out. I have to admit, I was a bit worried sending a photo with 2 dogs and asking for both to be printed on each pair I ordered but I couldn’t have been happier with them!"
PupSocks,2021-01-04T12:58:16Z,5,"The socks came out awesome, when you realized the post office lost my package you sent a replacement out without me even sending an email letting you know I hadn’t received my purchase.  I will definitely be using you again for my gifts."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T12:56:41Z,1,didn’t even receive my order. Ordered it a month ago.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T12:41:13Z,5,Received my socks and they are fabulous! Pictures are perfect! I will ordering more!
PupSocks,2021-01-04T12:37:48Z,1,I’ve emailed several times to no avail. The socks came in AFTER Christmas and WITHOUT my dogs face on them. I’m so disappointed. Never again.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T12:28:10Z,4,"Product was beautiful and pup pictures were great quality :)Socks are a bit thin, but are still a nice material. Shipping took a couple of weeks, likely the holiday rush. Overall happy with purchase."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T12:25:53Z,1,"Ordered 2 months before Christmas, took them a month to even ship. Of course the order did not arrive in time. Waste of time."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T12:16:54Z,1,Terribly disappointed in the socks. They have no stretch whatsoever and you cannot wear them. Way overpriced for something so expensive.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T11:36:24Z,4,"The recipients loved their socks. I gifted socks of their beloved dog that passed away. Glad they loved it because ordering off a phone wasn’t easy. In fact, I thought I had selected one blue and one pink but some how got two pink. But again, they didn’t care about the color, they were so thrilled over the memorial socks."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T11:30:36Z,1,Communication was terrible. Took a month to get blanket
PupSocks,2021-01-04T10:52:14Z,5,"I love my custom made face masks by PupSocks. They are perfect. The mask itself is soft and very comfortable. The little toggles are easy to instal and make the mask a good fit for even a smaller face. Service is great. My delivery was slightly delayed by the Christmas rush, but the team from PupSocks sent through a digital mock-up of each design I ordered so that I could see the finished product. Very happy with the service, quality and overall finish of my custom face masks. These were made to commemorate my beautiful Keeshond who recently passed away. A very fitting tribute. Thanks PupSocks ❤️"
PupSocks,2021-01-04T10:43:57Z,1,Terrible experience. I placed my order on October 27th and still haven't recieved it.I've sent them multiple emails requesting an explanation and no reply since December 18th.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T10:33:06Z,1,"I never receive my order made half november !!! It was a gift, I’m really disappointed and will expect a total refund about it."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T09:24:03Z,3,The material that the socks are made from is different.  Kids do not want to wear them because of it.  I gave it 3 stars because of the laughs and smiles that it created.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T09:22:11Z,5,"My order was received before Christmas, during a very busy time!  The picture on the sock turned out great!"
PupSocks,2021-01-04T09:08:25Z,1,I ordered a custom blanket just after thanksgiving for my wife’s birthday on 12/10. I still haven’t received my blanket and it’s 1/4. I have emailed a couple of time and get the same story about holiday shipping even though I ordered in more then enough time to have received my order. I absolutely will never order from pup socks again and I will advise anyone I know to do the same. Of it was possible I would give them negative stars. As of today my order still says in production and it was supposed to have been shipped a couple days of my order.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T08:38:24Z,3,"I loved the items I received, very good quality. The only downside is I received them a few days later than the expected delivery date, which was disappointing because these were supposed to be Christmas gifts."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T07:59:48Z,4,"These socks are so cute and make a great gift. They processed quickly, shipping out within 3 days of the order. Unfortunately due to holiday shipping delays that were problematic all over the US, they arrived about 30 days after that. But it was worth the wait to surprise the recipients."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T07:17:46Z,2,Socks arrived and did not even resemble the picture that  I sent of my daughters dog. I emailed the company and heard nothing back from them. Will be returning. They are also very tight like compression socks  and not made for ladies with thicker legs or larger feet!!
PupSocks,2021-01-04T07:08:11Z,5,This is the second pair of socks I have purchased and they always bring a smile to the persons face.  They are nice and thick. Great socks
PupSocks,2021-01-04T07:02:26Z,2,"Socks turned out cute but immediately after ordering, I contacted PupSocks to inform them that I made a mistake with the sizing when I placed my order. Since there is no phone number to contact them directly, I sent numerous emails so the issue could be fixed before it was too late. After about 2 weeks, I finally received a message telling me it was too late to make any changes. I distinctly remember when I placed my order reading on the website that PupSocks guaranteed satisfaction. Paying close to $30 for a pair of socks that doesn’t fit is disappointing to say the least."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T06:25:48Z,5,Great gift ideas. Quality items.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T06:24:33Z,1,I ordered these socks for my daughter on November 30th. As of today January 3rd I still have not received my order. I can recommend using this company when you don’t get what you order. I am disappointed in this company and I discourage others from using them until they get their act together.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T06:22:53Z,5,Everybody loves these! Amazing technology and I received them so quickly.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T05:32:10Z,5,"My neice who is a vet loved these socks! She wore them the whole day and said that they were pretty comfy. The image was almost perfect. All in all, would definitely order again."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T04:55:46Z,1,Ordered these first week of December and still waiting for delivery .... you could at least send an update via email !!!
PupSocks,2021-01-04T04:46:49Z,5,They did a great job on the blanket I ordered for my wife. I would order from them again.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T04:35:51Z,1,I haven't received the sock still.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T04:27:39Z,5,Socks are great! Quality and graphics better than expected.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T04:12:28Z,1,never received my order.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T04:09:07Z,2,"Ordered in late November, expected to arrive by Christmas. It is Jan 3rd and I have still not received my order."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T04:04:00Z,5,Got these as Christmas gifts and they were everything I wanted them to be! Couldn’t be more happy with them and the ones to receive them got a good laugh out of it!
PupSocks,2021-01-04T03:52:59Z,2,I sent 2 pictures and asked that you use the dog pics but instead you used my husband’s pic instead of the dog he was holding so the socks are 1 dog and 1 hubby.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T03:43:31Z,5,"The actual socks were of average quality,  but the picture was really clear and my daughter cried.  It was great!!"
PupSocks,2021-01-04T03:42:11Z,1,"Ordered November 30. Did not receive until January 2. Horrible customer service. I was unable to ever receive any responses to my emails and Facebook messages concerning the unacceptable delay with my order. After 2 weeks of my order status saying “processing” I finally did receive 1 email from customer service offering a 15% discount. I never received another word from anyone despite my many follow-up emails and inquiries. I heard hundreds of stories of people receiving the incorrect order when they finally did receive their order. I guess I was one of the lucky ones because my order was actually correct and the product was decent. The face mask was really cute. The socks were acceptable quality. However, due to the lack of customer service and extensive delays, I would assume this company is in way over its head. I would suggest ordering from another company. There are many options on Etsy."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T03:34:43Z,5,"So it’s a little expensive, but don’t let that put you off! The money goes to a great cause and if that’s not enough, trust me, you will be delighted when you receive your parcel. The socks are excellent quality and the pictures are wonderful. This was a Christmas gift for my son and he loved it. Thank you so much, I will definitely be a return customer.Happy New Year!"
PupSocks,2021-01-04T03:29:31Z,5,"I gifted these for a Christmas present...he absolutely loved them! Got tons of laughs & an “I love them!” A unique & thoughtful gift from his little love Boo(his cat) Socks are a great color green, picture on point! Took longer than usual to get, EVERYTHING did this season though! If you you need a gift for a pet lover, you’ll hit the jackpot with these socks!"
PupSocks,2021-01-04T03:14:13Z,5,Great gift for my mother!
PupSocks,2021-01-04T03:13:30Z,1,I’m still waiting to receive the order I placed that was supposed to arrive in time for Christmas (but did not)
PupSocks,2021-01-04T03:09:08Z,5,These were way over expectations. It looks just like our Tucker. Thank you just wish we could get different colors.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T03:03:48Z,3,Liked the socks! But the sizes were not accurate and the material is quite stiff.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T03:03:09Z,5,"These amazing gifts are perfect for the animal lover in your life.   Couldn't be happier, will order again."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T02:56:32Z,1,They sent me the wrong socks and have never replied to my email and it's been over a week on top of them coming late after Christmas
PupSocks,2021-01-04T02:48:38Z,5,"I was worried that this was a scam, but the day the socks arrived I was so pleasantly surprised on how cute they were! My son got a dog this year and it was a great gift for him.  Thank you for getting them to me before Xmas!"
PupSocks,2021-01-04T02:47:20Z,4,"I liked the blanket and sock sets (2 sets) I purchased as holiday gifts.  The socks, though graphically cute, don't fit really well because they don't have a true sock shape; they are ""flat"" and pucker at the bend from the top of the foot to ankle.  I realize the shape is likely to accommodate the printing process."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T02:42:26Z,3,"I love the concept and the pictures as they are cropped, However the fabric isn’t a favorite of my grandkids. Plus there are no sizes for younger preschool kids."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T02:35:49Z,5,Christmas gift PupSocks delighted the receivers..it was special for them.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T02:22:21Z,5,"Ordered 7 pairs of socks for the first time from Pupsocks, and I had a great experience. Socks arrived on time. My family members loved them! At first look, I thought they looked a little stiff, like they wouldn't be comfortable. But once I wore them, they were very comfy. Highly recommend!"
PupSocks,2021-01-04T02:19:12Z,4,Cute socks.  The dog picture was very clear.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T02:17:02Z,5,"Fast shipping,great quality!"
PupSocks,2021-01-04T02:15:38Z,1,Update: I received the correct socks today (original order was placed on November 22 and the product sent was of a dog that I had never seen). The replacement order received today (January 4) is correct. The socks are indeed adorable.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T02:14:19Z,5,They were perfect. My grandson loved them
PupSocks,2021-01-04T02:11:45Z,1,"I ordered my socks on December 6th, well ahead of time for Christmas. (They were still guaranteeing an arrival by Christmas all the way up to like the 16th.) It is January 3rd, and my order hasn't even shipped yet. They claim my order was finished and shipped on December 16th, but the tracking number says it is still in Atlanta, where they are located awaiting a shipping label to even be generated still. I've tried contacting them through email, but all I get is an auto generated email from the ""CEO"" stating that they're too busy to actually reply to me. So, I'm left with them taking my money and having no way to get in touch with them. Great, right? I'd recommend just finding someone on Etsy who can produce the same, if not better, product."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T02:10:51Z,1,Hard to review a product I have yet to receive. :(
PupSocks,2021-01-04T02:09:27Z,5,Looks and feels fantastic very happy
PupSocks,2021-01-04T02:00:19Z,5,"Got them as a gift for my sister. She was excited at first, then noticed it was HER cats on the socks. She loved them, and they look great."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T01:51:51Z,5,Great socks and fast shipping
PupSocks,2021-01-04T01:46:13Z,5,"I purchased the Hawaiian themed socks with our pup's picture as a gift for my daughter.The order process was fairly easy, the order arrived as promised, and the picture our dog turned out really nice on these socks. So far the socks seem like a good quality sock, and my daughter loves them. I would definitely order from here again!"
PupSocks,2021-01-04T01:42:55Z,3,"I was a little disappointed that the picture on the blanket was so dark. I felt like a filter or something could have been done to make the dog's face lighter. The blanket also seemed smaller and thinner than what I paid for. If my mother in law wasn't so happy simply because it had her dog on it, I would be more disappointed. Pricey for not extremely great quality."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T01:40:01Z,4,Your socks were the favorite Christmas gift. They would have gone over even better if I had received them before Christmas. But understandabley that was from no fault of yours guy
PupSocks,2021-01-04T01:36:37Z,4,Telling me to review products will never give you 5 stars.  Period.  Socks could be more comfortable but the picture quality was great.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T01:35:55Z,3,"Great delivery, time, just bad socks."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T01:29:43Z,5,Above and beyond to make the christmas arrival. Thank you!!
PupSocks,2021-01-04T01:28:41Z,1,Cute. But....horrible quality socks.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T01:26:19Z,5,"I was skeptical ordering again as my last order was very late—past Christmas. This time, however, the order arrived very soon. They did a great job cropping the pics I sent. The socks look great!!"
PupSocks,2021-01-04T01:20:30Z,5,Ordered 2 pairs of socks with 3 dogs.  They are fantastic!  What a great gift and fun conversation piece.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T01:19:47Z,1,I have never received my order.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T01:15:30Z,2,"Took too long to get, only one cat pic when I paid for two."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T01:10:40Z,1,I did not get my item at all and they did not respond to my emails for my undelivered item.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T01:05:47Z,5,Great socks! Pictures came out great! What a fun gift to give!
PupSocks,2021-01-04T01:00:44Z,1,Ordered and paid for on Nov 22 of 2020Still no delivery date as of Jan 3 2021
PupSocks,2021-01-04T01:00:11Z,3,"We have still not received our socks. The tracking number hasn’t changed in over 3 weeks- only says “label made”. I have attempted 3 emails to the company, and all 3 have been returned. I understand the business of the holidays- but the fact that I have not been able to send an email to/receive a response from the company is beyond disappointing. At this point- the socks are no longer wanted."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T00:51:51Z,1,"The material is really poor quality -- cool looking socks, but not very comfortable.  Also, we ordered three weeks before Christmas but the socks were delivered a few days after Christmas."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T00:46:41Z,1,I ordered a mask and a blanket and they only gave me the mask and it had the wrong dog on it
PupSocks,2021-01-04T00:40:53Z,2,Ordered 6 weeks ago and havent received any product nor have I received proper tracking. Attempted to email them and havent heard anything back about that either. Have tried to give benefit of the doubt with covid and excess mail but my patience has grown thin.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T00:40:39Z,2,"Socks are fine. Ordered on 11/28 but they didn’t ship until after 12/18. Didn’t receive until a week after Christmas. Processing took too long. If couldn’t fill order in timely manner, I should have been notified"
PupSocks,2021-01-04T00:36:24Z,1,Ordered 3 pairs of socks for Christmas gifts back in November 2020 and still haven't received packages as of January 2021
PupSocks,2021-01-04T00:35:30Z,5,Beautiful! Our kids loved their blankets! They are so soft and great quality. The picture of our Elle on them is perfect!
PupSocks,2021-01-04T00:34:19Z,1,"Order never arrived, emails go unanswered and I received emails to review my order when it never arrived."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T00:29:47Z,2,"EXTREMELY slow response times and delivery. I ordered PupSocks and a PupMask on December 5th, 2020. It is now January 3rd, 2021, and they still haven’t arrived. I understand that it was Christmas time, but come on... that’s why I ordered them three weeks before Christmas.A month late? Seriously."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T00:15:53Z,5,"This company went above and beyond my expectations, the design came out incredible and just blew my mind. I can’t wait to buy more. My family loved the customized masks and my dogs came out perfect and the designers followed my wishes perfectly."
PupSocks,2021-01-04T00:14:21Z,5,Got these socks for a coworker and she loved them!
PupSocks,2021-01-04T00:10:37Z,5,"Socks turned out awesome! Delivered timely, will order again, thank you! Very impressed and happy!!"
PupSocks,2021-01-04T00:10:13Z,4,I bought these socks for my son for Christmas and he absolutely loves them because he loves his dog.  My only issue is that they are not like normal cotton socks.  I am sure it is just the printing process but it was a little disappointing as they we not what I expected.
PupSocks,2021-01-04T00:00:54Z,1,Never received my item or a tracking number. Customer services takes up to 5 days to respond to any inquiry. will never buy from here or recommend this brand.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T23:58:57Z,5,I got a pup mask using one picture of our dogs face and it turned out awesome!! I had background in the picture and the designer was able to crop it out! Everything looked perfect and it is really good quality too!! 11/10
PupSocks,2021-01-03T23:57:35Z,1,"Considering I received my order with the wrong picture on the socks, did not have the correct socks in time for Christmas and have still not received them, I am very disappointed and would not order again or recommend."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T23:55:10Z,5,Loved the socks- great quality and quick turn around time.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T23:53:31Z,5,Love these Pupsocks! Bought as a present. The recipient was very pleased. Good quality; delivered on time. Good customer service. I’d buy again!
PupSocks,2021-01-03T23:52:46Z,5,Love them! They are perfect!!
PupSocks,2021-01-03T23:48:29Z,2,"The picture on the socks and mask looks pretty good and I’m happy with that. However, the fit of the socks is not that great (I thought I had it sized correctly). The fit of the mask is even worse.ore material and shape could go a long ways. Overall, I was not impressed, especially since the socks and mask combined was +$50 for something that we will probably never use. I appreciate what they’re trying to do, but would not recommend buying - especially the mask."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T23:46:47Z,5,I gave pup socks to several people for Christmas and they loved them. The process of ordering was simple and the product was fantastic! Thanks
PupSocks,2021-01-03T23:42:03Z,1,I ordered on 12/6/20 and still haven’t received the socks. These were supposed to be a Christmas present. I should have been warned (when ordering) that it would take over a month toReceive these. I was notified on 12/24/20 that they would be late.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T23:33:31Z,1,Ordered 2 blankets before the holiday deadline as Christmas gifts for my 2 kids. Order was received after New Years! The order is wrong and they sent me a blanket with someone else’s dog on it. Disappointed to say the least. 😢
PupSocks,2021-01-03T23:29:24Z,1,Blanket came 4 weeks late. Customer service was non existent. Don’t waste your time or money.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T23:28:51Z,1,I understand it's covid and was patient to receive my order but when the order finally came it was the standard dog from the website on the socks vs my dog I had sent pictures in on. I also ordered blue socks and got the standard white. Extremely disappointed and unhappy and will never order anything from here again.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T23:28:04Z,3,Recieved an empty bag. Sent an email about it a week later still no replyEdit: finally recieved a reply and replacements were sent.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T23:26:44Z,5,"My Dec. 7th order still has not arrived, but I know that is due to USPS delays and not PupSocks’ service.  I thought that sending the mock up while the delayed gift was sill in the shipping process was great service and I appreciated the proactive gesture. My mom is very excited about her socks. Hopefully, they come soon!!"
PupSocks,2021-01-03T23:26:26Z,3,"The print is fantastic but unfortunately the socks are a strange material and fit about 1"" wider than a regular mens size 10 sock."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T23:15:08Z,5,"Got these as a gift for my girlfriend and she absolutely loved them! Great purchase, great gift"
PupSocks,2021-01-03T23:11:18Z,5,"quick custom printing and shipping, especially for Christmas time! socks were adorable and quality of the photo was very very good! Socks were a big hit!"
PupSocks,2021-01-03T23:08:56Z,2,The idea behind this is nice but the quality of the socks are poor. They have a large seam and are not very comfortable. For $25 the sock should be much better.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T23:03:08Z,5,The socks and blanket turned out nice.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T23:00:15Z,1,"Not only did the socks come way after Christmas despite being led to believe they would arrive in time, the socks are too big versus what sizes would indicate.  Terrible service - sub par product."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T22:55:17Z,1,"The picture came out perfect on the socks.  The issue is the size.  I bought the correct foot size, however they are not very stretchy.  I bought a large mens sock and I wasn't even able to get them over my foot and I have a much smaller foot and leg."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T22:55:00Z,1,poor quality socks. Too long to process and produce order. Poor customer service response time.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T22:48:07Z,5,The socks are so cute! I like how this company keeps you in the loop with the status of your order. I have already ordered another pair.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T22:46:56Z,3,"Super cute - but do not fit well and aren't comfortable at all, material is very stiff."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T22:40:42Z,1,"Hard for me to review when I still have not received them. Ordered the socks over a month ago. Date of arrival was estimated around the 19th or 20th of the month and I still haven’t received them. I may change this once I get them, but I doubt it."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T22:34:53Z,1,"I placed my order November 22, 2020.  Today is January 3, 2021 and I don’t even have a tracking number, nor do I know when the blanket I ordered will be shipped.  An email I received before Christmas stated they were working hard to fill all orders placed before December 11th. I don’t know why I didn’t receive my blanket, but they kept my money.  The blanket was to be a Christmas gift for my husband. One of our dogs passed away the first week of December.  This blanket would’ve been the perfect gift for him.   I’m so disappointed not both not receive the blanket nor have communication telling me when I might receive the blanket. I’m still waiting....."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T22:32:16Z,1,Ironic that you send me a link fora review when I still haven’t received my socks I ordered 5 weeks ago!!The day before Christmas you sent me an email with a photo of the socks you you were supposed to send.Poor customer service and terrible delivery system
PupSocks,2021-01-03T22:29:05Z,5,Coming from a 16 year old boy this was his favorite gift this year. I put pics of his 2 dogs and he absolutely loved them:)
PupSocks,2021-01-03T22:28:56Z,3,"Pics on the socks look good, but the fabric is much rougher and stiffer than I anticipated. Not comfy cozy at all. Also took much longer to get them out to us than was advertised. We ordered 3 weeks before Christmas and didn’t get them until after Christmas."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T22:25:45Z,2,"Placed order two months ago. One month in I get an email saying there was a manufacturing error, so my order was delayed and not yet in production. Dispatch email one week before Christmas.Did not arrive before Christmas (still hasn’t). No offer for postage refund or further communication. Two months from order and still no product received."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T22:24:02Z,1,I was very excited for this product as I knew my wife would love it. She actually ended up getting me the same product (socks) from a different company! I was severely underwhelmed with the quality of the Socks. They are made of a very uncomfortable material and the bottom of the foot was super wide and didn’t fit her at all. I ordered a medium and they didn’t even fit me and I wear a 11.5. She got me another product and it was much more comfortable and cheaper. For a 30 dollar pair of socks i was disappointed. I know I can’t return them but it’s a shame they will probably never get worn... would not recommended to others. Will probably not order another product from this company.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T22:20:24Z,2,"originally promised in 8-10 business days. Ordered on December 1 - arrived on December 31. Material is odd and feels synthetic. Sizing seems to be off - these are MUCH larger than expected. The graphics turned out great - so designer did an excellent job. Overall, I will not be ordering again."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T22:18:06Z,5,They are cute. Not what I was expecting but not in a bad way. Socks are silky-smooth.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T22:16:59Z,1,Still have not received my shipment! Ordered on 12/4. Reached out and got automated response. No one seems overly concerned that customers have not received Christmas gifts yet!!!
PupSocks,2021-01-03T22:15:43Z,1,"Placed an order 22 November and it’s now 3 January and I haven’t received my items. Sorry,  but can recommend I company with that slow delivery."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T22:10:42Z,5,I bought a blanket for my daughter as a Christmas present. Submitted 2 photos of her Yorkies.  The blanket looked awesome and she loved it.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T22:09:15Z,5,"My partner got me socks of my dog’s face and I was so pleasantly surprised. So adorable, great quality of his face!I wish maybe the socks could be softer, but understand that the quality of his face may not come come out quite the same :)Thank you!"
PupSocks,2021-01-03T22:05:43Z,1,My order went out o thr wrong address by one number. You have no customer service 800 number to call and it’s all emails with jo live response! I spent nearly $200. On a blanket and 2 pairs of socks only to get returned to you fromNovember 30 and no answer to my pleas to get it re-routed to the correct address!!! Thanks for ruining the Xmas gift I had so happily purchased! I am STILL WAITING FOR A DAMN REPLY - I keep getting automated replies but no answers as to where my order is!!!!
PupSocks,2021-01-03T22:05:17Z,5,"After receiving the wrong order initially, PupSocks sent me the correct order.  The socks are great!"
PupSocks,2021-01-03T22:04:26Z,3,"I asked that the photo be cropped differently than just the face of my dog - to include the background (Christmas Tree). My request was ignored, and only got the pooch's face - It would have been a lot more fun with the Christmas tree included, as I requested!"
PupSocks,2021-01-03T22:02:40Z,4,The socks were a big hit as a gift.  The picture of his pet was cute and as a novelty item it was fine.  The socks could have been better for wearing.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T22:02:20Z,1,It has been well over a month since I ordered. I still have no received my order. Communication with Pupsocks is horrible. No one gets back to me.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T22:02:00Z,5,I ordered two pair of PupSocks as a Christmas gift and was very pleased with the quality of the socks. The pictures were clear and bright. The socks were a huge hit! I will definitely purchase more. Great gift!
PupSocks,2021-01-03T22:01:32Z,1,Although I ordered weeks ahead my gift arrived the day after Christmas. The quality was disappointing and the images were too dark. If I had received it sooner and seen how bad everything was I would have thrown them away. I would not order again.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T22:00:40Z,1,"Delivery to Ottawa, CA and it is taking a month and I still haven’t received my order"
PupSocks,2021-01-03T21:58:31Z,5,Socks arrived as expected.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T21:56:27Z,5,I ordered a pup blanket for my 17 year old son whose the main care giver of our 14 year old shih tzu Princess Leia.  It was on his bed Christmas morning. Sounds silly since he’s 6’2.  He will forever miss her when she’s gone. The blanket captured the picture I sent perfectly. He will forever has the blanket with her cute face all over it.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T21:56:09Z,1,You sent me the wrong product. I emailed customer support and gmail could find the email address. I spent 20 bucks on one pair of socks with a random dog picture on it.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T21:55:22Z,5,Adorable mask - the photo of our dog came our great!
PupSocks,2021-01-03T21:54:24Z,4,"The blanket I ordered came out pretty great! Everyone who’s seen it has been in love and thought it was a great gift. The only problems I have is that for some reason, one of the two cat faces seems to be darker and in slightly less detail than the other (I did my best to make sure both photos were in good detail and well lit), and my order took a lot longer to get here than I had hoped. At the time they were advertising “ready to ship next day”, it was just over a week before the order was confirmed ready to ship, and a little longer for it to actually leave. As well, I assume because of the border, or just a backlog of orders, my package sat in Miami for about two weeks. I ordered the blanket November 23rd, it arrived on December 28th. Pandemic and holiday season aside, I completely understand delays, but the quick turnover advertising sold me on it, and that wasn’t the case."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T21:48:03Z,1,Didn’t receive my socks yet . Ordered dec 6 and still waiting
PupSocks,2021-01-03T21:48:02Z,1,Never received our socks after 4 weeks
PupSocks,2021-01-03T21:46:55Z,4,I appreciate the email with the mock up to surprise my nephew with. Great customer service. They fit a teensy bit tight but are otherwise delightful.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T21:42:58Z,5,Sizing was good and pictures turned out great.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T21:41:51Z,1,"Pretty sure in my emails you understand I was disappointed and the fact that your auto response kept telling me someone would contact me within 72 hours or something only to finally get some token email expressing your apology about a week after they did finally arrive which was after Christmas and essentially 16 days after they supposedly shipped doesn’t help in me providing a positive review. The socks are cute and that’s all I can give you. Not sure I will ever order again but if I do, I will have to prepare more than a month ahead of time."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T21:39:35Z,5,"Very cute and unique idea, and great initiative."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T21:38:41Z,1,"I have not received my order.  I ordered my pup socks on December 6, 2020 and have not received my socks yet.  It is now after Christmas on January 3, 2021.Thank you! We received the socks and my daughters love them."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T21:38:07Z,1,I still have bot received my order yet.  And  have received nothing but a picture from you on Christmas Eve to give to my daughter. I ordered on December 6th and was guaranteed delivery by ChristmasJohn Fleming215 870 6028 cell
PupSocks,2021-01-03T21:36:56Z,1,Never received my order but was charged for it. I tried to inquire multiple times but was told “it was delivered to a post office so pupsocks is  not responsible.” How can you charge for an item that was never delivered? I think your company is a complete scam.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T21:35:24Z,1,"I was super excited and looking forward to the order I placed dec 6, with a guarantee delivery by dec maybe 20? 8 business days! It’s now into January and NOTHING. with no valid response. Shipped dec 13? But not trackable! Don’t waste your time! Not if you thought their promises were true!"
PupSocks,2021-01-03T21:32:24Z,5,"Perfect gift idea! High-quality image & printing. The socks themselves seem pretty inexpensive, but they are fun for what they are. Good price."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T21:30:56Z,1,Image color was off and image quality was poor (pixelated)
PupSocks,2021-01-03T21:28:25Z,2,"Meh. The pictures were printed correctly as per our photos, but that’s about the only thing that’s good about them. The socks are a gross shape, a giant rectangle that’s way too long in the length, and they don’t stretch in width without showing the black weave. Expensive unwearable, decorative socks (especially as they weren’t in my local currency, so even more expensive than I thought once converted). Disappointing."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T21:28:18Z,4,"Great quality, Customer Service is excellent. There was an issue with my initial order, customer service representative handling is quickly and had things fixed ASAP"
PupSocks,2021-01-03T21:27:24Z,5,PERFECT!!!!!!!  WILL SHOP AGAIN
PupSocks,2021-01-03T21:22:34Z,2,"Poor quality of socks, photo on socks is faded looking not crisp and clear. Shipping was so slow, arrived after Christmas. Would not order from this company again."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T21:22:13Z,5,The blanket is wonderful! Love the quality and how our pups photos look on it. You did a great job!
PupSocks,2021-01-03T21:21:49Z,1,"The order was late-I placed the order on 12/6, and it did not arrive by Christmas. I don’t think sending a picture of the order and a coupon was adequate in making amends for that.  Also, the mask is thin, and it doesn’t fit well."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T21:19:53Z,5,They did a great job of putting our pup on the socks!!! Thanks guys!!!!
PupSocks,2021-01-03T21:19:34Z,1,I reached out to the company twice with concerns about my package tracking information and received no response. I finally received a bag form the company and quickly realized that it was empty and there was a large hole at the bottom or the bag. I reached out to them to see how they could replace them for me and again got no response.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T21:18:04Z,1,Still haven’t received the things I’ve bought
PupSocks,2021-01-03T21:17:41Z,1,"I am very disappointed.  I never received my product. I have tried to contact the company twice but only get a generic ""we received your email and will get back to you soon "" message. I have put off entering my review to give them time to figure out what may have happened.  My item tracking was last recorded at a USPS center in Georgia 4 weeks ago and nothing since then. At this point I would not recommend buying from this company.  Looks like they sell a great product but if you pay and never receive it, well thats a scam in my book."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T21:16:52Z,2,"2 stars because the photo turned out great and these shipped quicker than I thought BUT the socks fit sooooooo weird. I gifted a pair to two different people and both of them said the socks were cutting off circulation from being so tight on the top part of the ankle and then the socks were loose fitting everywhere else on their foot. Also these socks are by no means a soft and comfy material, it’s purely for the look of whatever photo/background you choose. In the end, this purchase was such a bummer! And based off past reviews, doesn’t seem like I should even waste my time trying to get a refund/exchange. Lol I need to stop buying from companies like this."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T21:11:49Z,5,My son loved his pup socks!  A friend saw them and plans on ordering a pair as a gift.  Thank you.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T21:09:13Z,5,After reading the horror stories of others (after I had already placed my order) I was worried about what I would receive or if I would receive anything at all. Let me just say it came on time and it was PERFECT. My daughter LOVES her blanket and I couldn't be happier. I would definitely order from here again. Thank you Pupsocks!!
PupSocks,2021-01-03T21:07:28Z,1,"Never received my item. Scam, check BBB rating. Please don’t order from here!"
PupSocks,2021-01-03T21:05:46Z,1,Christmas gift ordered on 12/6.  I was Informed I would receive my order in 12-15 business days.  It is 1/3 and I still have not received the order.  I did not have a delivery issue with any other items I ordered for Christmas. No communication from the company.  I will not order from them again.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T21:04:19Z,4,Our socks arrived today and my daughter was thrilled!!! Very thankful the company sent a mock up for me to gift my daughter while we waited for the shipping delay due to covid.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T21:02:18Z,4,"This was my second purchase from pupsocks! Products are always amazing and great quality. The only draw back was the delivery this Christmas. Very delayed and no customer service response to any inquiries I had. I assume it was growth issues as I know the popularity increased quite a bit this year! But, as always, LOVE the products!"
PupSocks,2021-01-03T20:58:10Z,5,I bought a pair of socks for my mom and she loved them!!  She couldn’t stop showing them off!!!
PupSocks,2021-01-03T20:55:19Z,1,"My reason for the low review is solely based on the shipping time it has taken to get my socks. I ordered them on November 22nd for my dad and brothers birthday’s, which are in mid December. I figured that if they were late, I could at least use them for Christmas gifts. Unfortunately, as of today (Jan 4) they have yet to arrive. As such, my review can only be based on my experience thus far, which is poor."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T20:55:06Z,1,I ordered my pair almost a month ago now....and are still not here..maybe if I ordered them in June they would have got here in time.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T20:53:58Z,5,Gave them as a Christmas gift to a family member who had just lost her cat and dog. She loved them! She said they’re comfy and a sweet gift
PupSocks,2021-01-03T20:52:25Z,1,They sent me someone else’s socks with pictures of kids on it! I am so mad! I ordered socks for my nephew with his dog on it! They will not respond and have not credit me
PupSocks,2021-01-03T20:46:06Z,4,The picture is good but the fit is a little wonky.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T20:45:06Z,2,"The material clearly was chosen more for its printability, not for its appeal or comfort.l"
PupSocks,2021-01-03T20:44:04Z,1,"I still have NOT received my order that I placed on December 6th, with guaranteed Christmas delivery!  When I check the status,  it says ""in production "".  I have emailed 5 times and have only received generic, ""thanks for your patience "" emails to two of them.  I am beyond upset and truly disappointed!"
PupSocks,2021-01-03T20:43:22Z,1,"You sent me the wrong size socks with the wrong picture on them. I tried to contact you via email for a refund, but you never got back to me"
PupSocks,2021-01-03T20:38:52Z,1,Never received order placed the first week of December.  Tracking says it is in pre-shipment.  Email said it was shipped 12-14-2020.  Cannot reach anyone in customer service.  Very disappointed and I am requesting full refund of $35.26 for order 2500698.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T20:37:25Z,1,"READ BEFORE PLACING ORDER!!! YOU WILL NEVER SEE YOUR MONEY OR ORDERED PRODUCTStill waiting for order that was placed on 11/22/20. Rec'd correspondence that there was an ""error in processing"" on 12/22. The solution was 25% off purchase and cont to wait or a complete refund. I replied a complete refund and within an hour recd an email telling me my order has been shipped! Funny now the tracking number is invalid and no way to obtain what we paid for as a gift to our daughter. Thanks PupSocks for avoiding person to person contact, taking $48.00 without fulfilling the order and being such a professional company. The Houle FamilyUPDATE ****We did receive our order, that issue finally resolved. The complaint from our daughter is that the socks are VERY FIGHT on the ankle and calf area and big in the foot area. She is 13, with normal body size.  Went by the sizing chart and ordered from there. What seemed like a great idea feels like an epic fail. 🤷🏼‍♀️ If this helps one person to save their time and money, worth it to me.The Houle Family"
PupSocks,2021-01-03T20:36:04Z,5,Beautiful well made blanket! Looked identical to my pup!!
PupSocks,2021-01-03T20:36:03Z,5,This was a good buy - I ordered 2 different pairs of socks and a face mask.  All that I ordered was of good quality and the pictures I provided were clear and accurate.  The products themselves were of good quality as well.  Also - customer service was very good in providing information that the order was to late.  They also provided a mockup of the gifts for me to give out on Christmas Day.  I look forward to using Pupsocks again.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T20:35:39Z,5,Thank you for a job well done!  We love the pup socks!
PupSocks,2021-01-03T20:33:44Z,5,"the gift was well received and loved, the service was great"
PupSocks,2021-01-03T20:32:49Z,5,"I absolutely love these socks!  The picture looks exactly like my dog. I received them in less than a week!  Not the most comfortable sock, but who cares?!?  They’re a perfect gift!!"
PupSocks,2021-01-03T20:27:58Z,1,"They Sent me wrong order.  Ordered socks with 2 cats, got 3 dogs instead.The only response I got was an auto-response.  Over and over.When I finally got an email one week AFTER Christmas, it just said, here is your tracking number, I hope that helps.  And the tracking number was for the DOGGIE socks I told the I RECEIVED!Seriously, isn't packing and shipping about the most important things in a company who's business is all about custom made products?"
PupSocks,2021-01-03T20:27:09Z,5,Exactly what I ordered.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T20:24:53Z,1,"Horrible service - I ordered Dec 6th and still have not received my order! I have asked for updates and get the same ""Auto Reply"" back.  The company even sent out an email Dec 12th saying today is the last day for orders to guarantee delivery for Christmas.  This order was four presents for my family.  Very disappointed as I was SO excited for the blankets and socks."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T20:23:52Z,5,The gift that keeps on giving! Great quality product!
PupSocks,2021-01-03T20:23:11Z,3,"The socks are not what I expected for the price I paid!  The material is not soft and it seems to be a unisock, fitting all sizes except little children, which are the ones that would wear this kind of sock.  Dissappointed."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T20:22:23Z,3,"Happy with the quality of the masks ordered, but it took over one month to receive them. I imagine they received a lot of orders before the holidays and the post office was slower than usual, but the website said I'd received them in 8-10 business days, and I didn't receive any communication to inform me that it would be longer than that."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T20:21:04Z,1,I ordered 3 pairs. 2 correct and the third didn’t have my daughters cat but someone’s dog.  I sent and email Christmas Eve when I received the socks but have yet to receive how to resolve the issue.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T20:08:38Z,5,"Everything was delivered as promised. Took a little while , but everything came in. Excellent quality, great gift for the animal lover."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T20:00:17Z,5,My daughter was thrilled to receive her socks.  The company did a great job in cropping only the portion of the picture I sent in.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T20:00:07Z,5,My order was of high quality. Great printing work and editing. My mom loves it!
PupSocks,2021-01-03T19:52:20Z,1,"I order these socks a month ago and still haven’t received them. Therefore I can not give a good review as I have paid for the socks and I know they’ve be made, I just have not received them. Very disappointed 😞"
PupSocks,2021-01-03T19:52:10Z,1,Sox are super tight and feel like cardboard.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T19:50:46Z,2,Received the wrong item for a Christmas gift.  (Someone else’s dog) Sent email over a week ago and have yet to receive any response except a generic response that they will get to me eventually. Still waiting.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T19:48:28Z,1,"I ordered in advanced, and didn’t make it on time like you said it would.Then I still got adds saying if you order now you will get before Christmas.I should get my money back Total fail on your part."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T19:47:38Z,5,These were an amazing gift! I had a photo with my son holding my mother in laws new puppy. The cropping was great and we are all very pleased!
PupSocks,2021-01-03T19:47:34Z,1,"The design on the socks themselves was really cute. But the actual socks won’t even fit on my feet, and I’m not overweight by any means. The socks will not stretch around my ankles and the actual foot part of the socks it’s HUGE. Can’t even wear them when I paid $40 for two pairs of socks.EDIT: It’s almost been a month later and I’m still having problems getting the customer service team to respond to me. As soon as I asked for a refund of my money they stopped responding. Insane."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T19:43:38Z,5,"For Christmas, I bought a blanket for my husband with our dog’s face on it. (She will not snuggle up with him, so I told him that this was a way to get her “snuggles.”) The blanket came out terrific and I am so pleased! It’s very soft, is a great size (I got the larger of the two, and he’s a big guy, and it covers him completely when he sits on the couch), and the print of her sweet face is perfect and so clear. An excellent product! We just got a new puppy and I can’t wait to get one with his face - I will definitely be back to purchase again!"
PupSocks,2021-01-03T19:42:13Z,1,"Zero stars, order the socks in early Dec for xmas presents,  it's now jan 3rd.  Still no socks. Can't recommend."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T19:41:12Z,5,"the blanket was AWESOME!! QUALITY fabric, SO soft! the kids LOVED it and immediately started fighting over who was going to sleep with it. I think I need another one! LOL picture quality was amazing! very impressed!!"
PupSocks,2021-01-03T19:38:01Z,1,I ordered my products in early December and still have not received them. They haven’t even shipped. I requested a refund and never received it.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T19:36:02Z,5,Great! Kids were please with their personalized socks :)
PupSocks,2021-01-03T19:33:28Z,1,"Ordered 2 masks 12/6/21for a Xmas present. Still have not received them. I know there is a mail delay, but I have ordered other things after I ordered from here & have received those things already. Inquired about the status of my order but only ever received a generic response. Wouldn't order from here again."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T19:28:33Z,3,"I have ordered pupsocks before and loved the socks. However, this year our order took over a month to arrive, missing the holiday gift giving time by a week. One of the masks featured a strange dog we've never seen before rather than the image of our dog we submitted. We had one mask, a blanket, and three pairs of socks that turned out perfectly. Just be aware that you may receive a random item you didn't order. Efforts to reach out to customer service went unanswered."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T19:26:27Z,2,Didn’t really love the socks themselves or the how the picture of our dog came out.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T19:19:13Z,4,The socks and mask look good. Only problem was how long it took to be delivered. I ordered them December 4th and they arrived after Christmas.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T19:14:55Z,1,Company ignored all my contact attempts. They didn’t even ship my product out for 13 business days. It was supposed to arrive between 12-15 days. Disappointed and now the gift is useless as it was too late. Took over a month to arrive to me.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T19:14:53Z,3,The socks are very cute. I purchased them knowing they would be a hit on Christmas morning except they did not arrive until January 2. I ordered them on November30th with the expectation they would arrive on time as they were advertised as a fun Christmas gift. Its been a hard year for everyone...guess I had hoped for something silly to brighten our day. Also I have 2 pairs of socks that belong to someone else...
PupSocks,2021-01-03T19:12:31Z,1,Socks never showed up.  They were supposed to be a Christmas gift.  I won’t do business with this company again.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T19:11:46Z,5,"Excellent socks, my wife loved them with her cats on them!!"
PupSocks,2021-01-03T19:03:49Z,5,"My son loved the socks with his pup on them! Delivery took a really long time, but that’s not your fault!"
PupSocks,2021-01-03T19:02:08Z,1,Where are they? I may be able to write a fairer review when I get them!
PupSocks,2021-01-03T19:01:30Z,5,Ordered a blanket for my sister in law with her two dogs heads on it. The blanket arrived timely and was very nice quality. My sis in law was so excited she had tears in her eyes. She said it was her favorite Christmas gift. Highly recommend!
PupSocks,2021-01-03T19:01:05Z,2,"I will just post what I put on my Instagram before Christmas. Another company to be wary of. @pupsocks blames the post office yet they don’t even have the package yet. (Ordered on 12/6/2020) Then they sent me an email every single day telling me that it’s almost Christmas and asking do you want to order something. It’s the last chance for it to get to you before Christmas. How about you send the one that I already ordered. If you can’t make the custom product before the date promised, do not  take a person's money. Pretty simple. They also only send you an automated response in the email that says they will get back to you in 72 hours well now it’s 96 hours and I still haven’t heard from them. I guess I’m not getting this in time for Christmas. I received the mask on Monday, December 28th. While I liked the design of the mask, I do not feel like you can wear it alone. It needs to be worn over a surgical mask. It's a cute novelty gift but I am glad I got my sister in law another gift. $30 was too much for this gift. I should have gone with the socks. I hear they are fantastic. FYI they finally responded to my email and my Instagram today. 1/3/21. Yeah, not satisfied with this company."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T18:58:06Z,5,I’ve ordered several products from here and I’m never disappointed. Good quality. The socks and face masks are so cute!
PupSocks,2021-01-03T18:57:04Z,1,I have not received my order!
PupSocks,2021-01-03T18:56:33Z,5,My boyfriend loves his cat socks
PupSocks,2021-01-03T18:54:31Z,1,"Placed order on Dec. 6th, one would think that would be PLENTY of time to arrive by christmas. Oh no! It is Jan. 3rd the following year and my item still hasn't even shipped. The biggest slap in the face is that I was getting advertising emails all the way up until the week before christmas saying 'there's still time to receive your order by christmas!!"" I understand that there can be shipping problems, but don't flat out lie to get people's money and then leave them hanging. What a scam."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T18:51:34Z,5,A bit on the expensive side.  After I placed the order I saw other sites that were cheaper.  But overall happy with the purchase.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T18:49:30Z,5,"A little expensive, but very nice.."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T18:48:08Z,4,"It took extremely long for me to receive my order. I ordered back on Dec. 6th and did not receive my order until Jan. 2nd. They did come out super cute and I did end up receiving an extra pair of one. Not really sure why. In the end everything worked out, I’m just a little upset that they didn’t arrive in time for Christmas."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T18:47:51Z,5,"Socks are comfortable, the picture was perfectly captured. Gave a pair each to son and fiancé of their new puppy, needless to say it was perfect!"
PupSocks,2021-01-03T18:46:32Z,2,"My order was placed 1 month ago. They “shipped” 3 weeks ago. Still no sign of them. Company says it’s the post office, we shall see if they ever show up."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T18:46:17Z,1,I really like the image  and what  you stand for. The image was beautiful. The problem was that the fit of the sock is not correct instead of the heel haven’t give the material bunches on the top of the ankle. And there’s no stretching us to the material. I was very disappointed because I gave them for Christmas gifts. They really should be made with a softer more stretchable material
PupSocks,2021-01-03T18:43:23Z,1,Still have not received my order and have yet to receive a reply from customer service.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T18:42:09Z,4,"My order took longer than I expected to be shipped, and then the post office sent it all around the country so it did not arrive till 5 days after Christmas! Ugh! But the socks are very cute!"
PupSocks,2021-01-03T18:41:27Z,5,My granddaughters love their pupsocks
PupSocks,2021-01-03T18:38:53Z,1,I ordered this for Xmas on 12/6 and still haven’t received it. $40 for one pair of socks slowest shipping possible. Terrible. Don’t buy these.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T18:38:28Z,1,"I still haven’t received my socks, order 2542263It was sent to an  incorrect address, was supposed to be re sent, but still hasn’t.Correct address:Brad Fleischer 402 e 10th st apt 2DNY NY 10009"
PupSocks,2021-01-03T18:38:22Z,5,Best gift ever. I ordered a couple pair for my adult son and he loves them!!! Quality was great and picture of his dog brought smiles to everyone.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T18:37:08Z,4,"I give the socks a 5 out of 5. Good quality and our friends loved them! Customer service could use some work, which is why I rated this product 4 stars. Yes, I ordered these during a busy holiday season which means demand likely exceeded the manpower to keep up. However, the messages I sent to inquire about my delivery after shipment was delayed over a week were never followed up with. A simple acknowledgement that my message was received would have been better than nothing at all. Thankfully, my products arrived about a month after I placed the order. Will keep this in mind if I place another PupSocks order in the future."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T18:35:43Z,5,It was the perfect gift for my best friend- she loves it! Thank you!!
PupSocks,2021-01-03T18:34:48Z,4,The socks look just as I expected and directed. Fit is a little funky but theya re still fun and funny!
PupSocks,2021-01-03T18:31:34Z,4,"The order took about 5-6 weeks, but the blankets were very cute and soft. Just be sure to give yourself some time, especially around the holidays. Also, company communication could improve to let customers know when there is a delay."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T18:28:22Z,4,The picture was perfect and seem to be very well made socks. I was hoping they would be cozier socks however so I took off a star. They are more like mens dress sock material but are on the thicker side and high quality.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T18:27:04Z,5,"I got PupSocks for my step daughter for Christmas of her cousins dog who she loves so much. He's not with us anymore and she misses him all the time, anyways when she opened the gift she immediately started crying and said it was the best gift she received. Thank you for doing an amazing job. I will definitely use your company again."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T18:26:51Z,1,"I STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED THE SOCKS THAT I ORDERED ON DECEMBER 4!!!!!!  This despite the fact that I received a confirmation email on December 11 indicating that the socks were coming.   AND, when I sent an email inquiry on 12-24 as directed by the website, I got an autogenerated reply asking me to be patient.  Then.....nothing.  No further response or action to address the problem.  I'm gravely disappointed.  These were a holiday present for my 85-year-old father. The better part of $40 spent and no gift received.  Still waiting."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T18:24:15Z,1,"I wish I could give zero stars.  Horrendous customer service, horrible company.  I’ve been waiting 6 weeks for a gift that should have arrived mid December, it’s now 2021 and have still yet to receive the product or given an ETA.  Really terrible, do NOT purchase from this company."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T18:24:15Z,1,"Ordered 12/6/20, notified that a label was created on 12/12 and USPS says package has not been retrieved by them. Where is my order,  on 1/3/21????? No word from customer service despite attempts to reach them."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T18:23:13Z,1,I never received my socks
PupSocks,2021-01-03T18:20:55Z,1,Never received my product. I am really disappointed in this company.  I received and email that socks had a shipping label CREATED and nothing more.  They never left the production facility. I emailed the company and all I received in return was and automated message and never a follow up.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T18:19:39Z,5,The socks were a big hit with the kids in their stockings.  The picture was captured perfectly in the sock image.  It was funny because my sister in law ordered 2 pairs for her kids with their dogs image and the all wore them to Christmas dinner.  Great job thank u
PupSocks,2021-01-03T18:19:03Z,4,"My two items came looking great. Pictures are clear, cute, and exactly like the photo. I got a blanket and socks. The socks are thin and a weird material...but my husband hasnt tried them on yet. The blanket also is on the cheaper side. It took me 1 entire month to recieve. Maybe holidays or covid. Overall i like both items."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T18:17:19Z,2,"Pupsocks customer service is seriously lacking. The website said delivery would take 12-15 days, so I ordered them 6 weeks prior to Christmas, which seemed like ample time. When they didn't arrive i emailed twice but never received a reply. They finally arrived after Christmas.  The socks look cute and my friend enjoyed the thoughtful gift, but it was very disappointing to not have the gift for Christmas and to receive zero response to my queries."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T18:17:18Z,5,I ordered a blanket and it was just as I had expected!  The ordering process was very easy.  The first blanket I ordered was lost by USPS and PupSocks quickly remedied the issue by placing a new order.  There was absolutely no back and forth exchange of information to get this resolved.  Their customer service is fantastic.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T18:16:38Z,2,Product is overpriced for the quality of the item you get. Packaging was also very poor.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T18:15:04Z,5,"My son bought this for his girlfriend. She was thrilled. Shipping took longer than we hoped, but it got here before Xmas. The blanket is a good size and is so snuggly. The socks were also a good size. Overall a fun purchase."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T18:12:58Z,1,Bought these for our kids from Santa and these are awful.  Sizes are way off and they don’t look comfortable to wear whatsoever.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T18:11:00Z,3,Ordered a face mask and the textile was fine but the construction of the mask itself was not right for any kind of protection. Disappointed because I had hoped to use the company again.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T18:09:42Z,4,The socks are great although overpriced. I did purchase a mask and I was shocked at the size of it. At first I thought I mistakenly ordered a child’s size. I’m not even sure I can give this as a gift like I intended to.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T18:07:03Z,5,"My son loved his Christmas present socks and I can’t wait to order another pair. They did arrive after Christmas (ordered December 5) which was disappointing, but I know mail service was difficult this year. The socks looked great and are comfortable."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T18:05:58Z,1,"This company has been the absolute worst I've dealt with in a very long time. I ordered 2 blankets as a Christmas gift on December 6 and was supposed to receive them within 8-10 days. Once I didn't receive them, I looked for ways to contact the company. There is NO customer service phone number whatsoever. I emailed them about my order and received an automated response that I would hear from them within 72 hours. About a week went by and I get a generic email blaming the USPS. I went ahead and filed a dispute with Amex. A few days later I receive an email stating my order had shipped and provided a tracking number. I kept checking the tracking number, only to learn that the USPS never received the package. Basically they just printed a shipping label and never gave the package to the USPS. I also started doing some research on the company and found out they have been doing this to people since they started business THREE YEARS AGO. There are several news articles out of Atlanta about this. (A simple Google search will give you all the info you need on them.) Finally I receive a package on December 28 with the WRONG DOGS on them. I would NEVER do business with such a shady company and hope that this review prevents someone else from making the same mistake I did. I truly hope they get shut down for their fraudulent business practices."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T18:04:41Z,1,"Did not ship before Christmas, in fact still hasnt arrived as of january 3rd, when i ordered it around the 10th of December and was guaranteed my order for a christmas gift. My dad is starting to think i lied about his gift existing, f*** you pupsocks, merry christmas"
PupSocks,2021-01-03T18:03:56Z,5,We love our socks. Great printed face of Brady
PupSocks,2021-01-03T18:02:58Z,5,Love them! Crisp images and nice fit.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T18:02:26Z,4,"They came later than they were supposed to but, they are awesome socks! The kids loved them! Thank you again"
PupSocks,2021-01-03T18:00:48Z,1,"Order was placed Dec. 6 and we received a notice saying it had shipped Dec. 12. The USPS tracking number doesn’t work, and we’re not sure what the order status is; while we did get a note a few days ago, it was without substance, and we’re no closer to knowing the actual order status.This is all understandable, due to the pandemic and the government’s hollowing-out of the postal service, but I was hoping for a little more proactive action. Our previous orders have been fast and effective, and that’s why we keep ordering. Great product."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T18:00:08Z,1,I never received them.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T17:59:59Z,4,"Changed from 1 star to 4 stars. Finally received items ordered.  Blanket and socks were PERFECT!!  Very happy with the images and quality..  Not happy about the shipping, but what can ya do.."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T17:59:22Z,5,Loved my socks!
PupSocks,2021-01-03T17:59:06Z,1,Sent the wrong socks and won’t even respond to my email.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T17:58:56Z,4,Great customer service and cute product with my additional instructions followed nicely! Only criticism is the lateness (but that's half expected during the Christmas rush) AND the fabric itself. Polyester is a bit disappointing for socks i really wish they would offer a cotton or cotton blend fabric. Plastic is not eco friendly!
PupSocks,2021-01-03T17:56:07Z,1,"After waiting 6 weeks for a corrected order as I was sent cat socks when I uploaded my dog's photo, the socks are bad quality and not inexpensive. Im happy I did not have a big order. They lost my business."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T17:54:01Z,1,"Ordered 12/7. Didn’t get socks until 12/28. On the day I ordered, they were being marketed as “arriving before Christmas “. What a joke."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T17:53:35Z,5,The socks were a big hit with my family. Though it took longer than I thought for delivery (to Canada) the socks arrived just in time for Christmas.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T17:53:18Z,2,Order a pair for a Christmas gift back in mid-November and as January 3rd have still not received the socks. So much for a Christmas gift.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T17:52:09Z,2,"I ordered 2 images of my dog. Careful of dark images as the printing is not very clear. One image is okay , the other was terrible. The socks are also a weird size."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T17:51:58Z,5,I cannot say enough about how pleased we were with the quality of our blanket and the customer service provided.  We will definitely be returning customers.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T17:51:24Z,5,They turned out great!! We loved them!!
PupSocks,2021-01-03T17:50:22Z,1,"Quality is questionable, certainly not worth over $30 for a pair of socks delivered. It took 3 weeks to receive, way past Christmas. Overall, very disappointing."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T17:49:44Z,1,"Ordered on November 25 and still have not received order. I know postal system has been very busy over holidays, but if Pupsocks can’t guarantee delivery any better than this, should use FedEx or some other courier system where delivery isn’t a “crapshoot”. Hope to see a refund in the near future!"
PupSocks,2021-01-03T17:48:36Z,1,"Never will I order from this company again. I ordered my gifts on November 22, more than a month before Christmas. As of today, January 3rd, I have yet to receive my order except for one pair of socks out 7 items. I have emailed twice and received nothing but an auto reply with excuses. I will be contacting the Better Business bureau and disputing the charge with my credit card."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T17:48:29Z,4,"super cute.  The socks may be slightly larger than expected.  I had a bit of trouble understanding the ordering, how much of my dog's photo to submit so that I'd get a good dog head cropped, but it worked out great."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T17:47:12Z,2,"The quality of these socks is lacking, they are a tube of thin nylon fabric with very little shape. Calling them socks is a stretch for sure. Speaking of stretch, they barely do that. They are basically a novelty gift ... and an expensive one at that. It would be great to have had that novelty to open on Christmas morning. However, despite ordering the first week of December, they did not arrive until well after the holidays. Unknown to me, my sister ordered similar socks from a vendor in China. We ordered on the same day… Hers arrived in similar timing. Ironic that a vendor based in Georgia couldn’t deliver sooner than a vendor based in China during the middle of a global pandemic."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T17:45:28Z,1,"Ordered socks on December 6th, they still have not arrived (Jan. 3).  Did all of my Christmas shopping online, this was my 1st purchase, everything else arrived. Feels like a scam to me."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T17:45:17Z,5,Socks came out perfect!!
PupSocks,2021-01-03T17:44:29Z,1,Right now you would not get a favorable rating from me. I still have not received my order which hints that I probably will not order from you again.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T17:44:20Z,5,Excellent service with quick turn around shipping your order. The socks are adorable and a huge hit at Christmas!
PupSocks,2021-01-03T17:42:05Z,1,"This is a terrible website, the service is non existent and no communication. I have been waiting 4 weeks!!"
PupSocks,2021-01-03T17:41:05Z,5,This blanket is super soft and looks like it does on the website.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T17:40:36Z,1,My order was placed on 12/6 and still haven’t received it on 1/3.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T17:40:15Z,1,I placed my order on Dec 6 to arrive before Christmas and socks still haven’t arrived as of Jan 3.  USPS tracking number says shipping label has been produced but still waiting on product to ship. Very frustrating!
PupSocks,2021-01-03T17:40:11Z,5,"Bought a pair as a stocking stuffer for my husband. It was absolutely hilarious and he love them. I was worried the picture wouldn’t be clear when printed, but it was perfect! Will definitely buy again."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T17:40:05Z,2,"Order was placed on December 6 and has not arrived as of January 3rd.  I’m very disappointed in their customer service and the FACT that this order did not even ship until after Christmas.   For the prices of their merchandise, I expect much better service.   I’ll save the money in the future to donate to a local shelter.  Do. It order unless you just want to pay them money for nothing."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T17:39:08Z,1,Ordered this product in November for Christmas delivery. It is now January 3 and I have yet to receive my product or have my email inquiries answered. I would not recommend this company for anything.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T17:39:02Z,1,"I ordered my pup socks on 12/6/2020. It is now 1/3/2021 and I still haven’t received anything, including no follow up or courtesy outreach as to why my order is taking so long."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T17:38:38Z,2,"The socks are soft and appear to be of good quality, the pictures look amazing, but they are not constructed like normal socks. They fold and wrinkle up on top of your ankle which makes them uncomfortable to wear. I would think a sock company would know how to make comfortable socks especially when you spend $100 on 4 pairs. I will not buy again."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T17:34:38Z,5,Loved the quality of the product. Decently priced. My son loved the socks and masks
PupSocks,2021-01-03T17:34:29Z,4,Finished product was awesome and exactly what the photo that I submitted looked like.  The order process was a little tricky and it originally looked like I double ordered which is probably a fluke but the only reason I didn’t give it 5 stars
PupSocks,2021-01-03T17:29:54Z,1,I ordered my socks 1 month ago and still haven't received them! No response to my emails either
PupSocks,2021-01-03T17:29:54Z,1,"Really disappointed. When I became aware of pup socks I loved them as unique gifts and was so excited to get them. I decided to buy 4 - for various family members for Christmas. I ordered on 12/5 and received notice that my order was in production on 12/6 and that I would be notified when the order was shipped- so far so good. Then, radio silence. I followed up when the “8-10 business day” window for receipt of my order (as per their notice) was up. No response. I then checked order status and saw it was completed on 12/16 but hadn’t been shipped. I checked that tracking number everyday and it kept showing it hadn’t left the facility. Christmas Eve I get an email with a mock up of all 4 socks with an excuse of covid related shipping delays. I never used the mock ups, they were useless. I was just very disappointed that I didn’t have those gifts to give in person. I finally receive the socks when I returned home after Christmas. Now I have to mail them. And have them appear as an afterthought. Giving more accurate timelines would have managed the customers’ expectations much better. Or upping their production capabilities to fulfill their promises. Even being responsive to follow ups would have helped. Worse, in the days leading up to Christmas my inbox was flooded with ‘there’s still time to get these in time for Christmas’ type emails from them. If they couldn’t get my offer completed in time I don’t know how they would have been able to follow through with those later promises. Pretty sure there are many out there that they left in the same boat as they did me. On a good note, the quality is decent."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T17:26:20Z,2,"The product arrived extremely late, I did not expect it to take almost 4 weeks to receive. And I ordered the socks with two faces and the design was odd. The same face was repeated in a vertical line almost in a column type of way so the faces weren’t actually spaced out uniquely in the socks. I wouldn’t order again."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T17:25:52Z,4,"Great pictures, bad socks. The pictures on the socks were very well done! Better than I had imagined, in fact. However, the socks are a weird material, and can't really be worn as socks. Also, I ordered cat socks and they came with dog paws and bones on them. Not that big a deal, since no one in my family will actually be wearing them, and they still gave my family a big smile on Christmas morning!"
PupSocks,2021-01-03T17:24:47Z,4,"The socks came out GREAT! The picture very clear. The shipping did take a very long time, but I understand everything was backed up due to the the holiday’s and the vaccine distribution. Pup socks sent an email with an attachment I could print for Christmas morning so I could use this in place of the actual gift while we waited for it to arrive."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T17:24:05Z,1,Wrong socks delivered No response Auto response CRAP
PupSocks,2021-01-03T17:23:49Z,1,Ordered on December 6th. It is now January 3rd and I still don’t have my order.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T17:22:58Z,4,Ordered two pairs for my parents for Christmas and they love them! Their pups faces are clearly distinguishable and the socks are good quality (albeit a little bit slippery on hardwood floors). Only complaint is the shape of the sock leads to some bunching around the top of foot/ankle area which makes them a bit uncomfortable for prolonged wear. Overall love the product!!
PupSocks,2021-01-03T17:21:27Z,1,Still haven’t received them!
PupSocks,2021-01-03T17:21:22Z,4,The socks are pretty cute and the phot turned out well. I was frustrated with the shipping time and lack of communication. I realize that it was the holidays but was told if I ordered by a certain date they’d arrive in time. The order took 2 weeks longer and showed up after Christmas. Maybe next year they could prepare and be more communicative.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T17:20:42Z,5,My blanket came out better than I imagined it would! My daughter loved it!!
PupSocks,2021-01-03T17:19:21Z,1,"Cannot review an item I have not received- no updates available for weeks, very disappointed with this process , very close to demanding a refund."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T17:19:10Z,1,"I ordered from PupSocks on 12/6/20. I still had not received any update on my order as of 12/29/20. I reached out to customer service for an update and received an auto-reply from the ""cofounder/CEO"" with no information about how to request further updates. I have not received any further correspondence from PupSocks to follow up on my request. As a result, I filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau, where it joined some 550+ other complaints against PupSocks. Do not order from this company. I still have not received my requested refund (nor the products) and I expect this is a company engaged in fraudulent business practices as a matter of course."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T17:18:09Z,2,"The socks were a cool concept, but the material was crap and they came too tight. The picture was the only thing right about them. I wouldn't waste your money on it."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T17:17:43Z,1,"The material used feels cheaply made, wouldn’t buy again"
PupSocks,2021-01-03T17:17:02Z,5,The blanket with our dog’s face on it was a huge hit!  My son was thrilled.  It arrived just in time for Christmas!
PupSocks,2021-01-03T17:16:42Z,5,Quality was terrific and it arrived on Christmas Eve just like Santa promised. Well done.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T17:15:31Z,2,I got someone else’s dog
PupSocks,2021-01-03T17:14:35Z,1,"I wanted to give you a zero. Never got my order and your email address comes back as ""undeliverable"". What a scam and you have the balls to ask for a review."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T17:13:13Z,1,"I don’t like to leave poor reviews, but I’m very frustrated. I placed my order in November hoping to have it for Christmas. I still haven’t received it. I have tried contacting the company many times, but i just get a generic email saying they’ll get back to me. I finally got an email saying my order would arrive by Dec 28th, but I still haven’t received it. The tracking number they provided me doesn’t show anything. I have requested a refund (because of course they took my money) and the company will not respond. I either want the product or a refund"
PupSocks,2021-01-03T17:12:42Z,1,"Ordered December 4th. Never arrived. No communication - I emailed, messaged and posted on Facebook.  I ended up disputing payment through Amazon. Totally disappointing. If I could rate 0 stars I would."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T17:11:50Z,4,The socks were a gift for my husband. Even though they arrived after Christmas I showed him the mock-up and he was thrilled. My only note is that the face cropping on the images could be a little cleaner and maybe feathered around fluffier faces.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T17:11:20Z,1,Ordered socks 6 weeks ago and still haven’t received them. If you’re in a hurry don’t order from here
PupSocks,2021-01-03T17:11:08Z,5,Great likeness of my pups. My partner loves them!
PupSocks,2021-01-03T17:09:47Z,3,"The socks look great but the sizing was terrible.  I ordinarily wear a size 9 women's shoe and ordered a women's medium sock.  They are HUGE.  It appears to be a man's sock.  I've reached out to see if I can exchange, but haven't heard back yet. I realize they are super busy around the holidays, so will try to be patient."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T17:09:12Z,1,"I still have not received my order from December, 6, 2020. It is now January 3, 2021. Update: I received the order and the product is extremely poor quality. The images of the animals was fine but the socks are terrible. Extremely overpriced for unwearable items. A 20% off coupon from the seller would never trick me again into falling for this scam."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T17:09:11Z,4,"Socks and blanket turned out great, but shipping was slow."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T17:08:09Z,3,"Very cute, but not as comfy as I thought they would be."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T17:07:40Z,5,Amazing! Would definitely purchase more
PupSocks,2021-01-03T17:07:37Z,1,I received the wrong socks. I reached out to the customer service and have not had a response yet
PupSocks,2021-01-03T17:07:17Z,4,The pictures of the animals were great!!! The quality of the sock not so much.  The toes of the socks were straight and did not comply to the toes.  I bought 5 pai.rs and each one had the same problem
PupSocks,2021-01-03T17:06:49Z,5,"The blanket I ordered with one photo was way beyond what I really expected, ordering off of FaceBook.   Everyone loved it!   Great fabric, great weight and the colors right on!     Thank you!    and Pippin thanks you!   I will order from you again!     Marilyn"
PupSocks,2021-01-03T17:05:22Z,1,First product order in November came back wrong. Order a new product on Dec 8 and it still hasn’t arrived. Said it was complete and shipped on 14th. Emailed company and only reply is a form letter saying overwhelming surge in orders and postal delays. I call BS. Terrible customer service.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T17:04:07Z,5,"Very satisfied with how our Pupsocks turned out! I was hesitant to order, unsure of how the quality would turn out, but am very, very happy with how they turned out!"
PupSocks,2021-01-03T17:02:51Z,4,"High quality socks and my photo instructions were followed to the letter. Have gotten my wife a pair of these as a stocking stuffer each of the last two Christmases, and she loves them! The only spot for improvement would be supplying a shipment tracking number, so 4 stars instead of 5."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T17:01:45Z,5,Great gift for all those who love our pets!!  Great quality too!
PupSocks,2021-01-03T17:01:39Z,3,"Customization is great, but the actual socks are an odd material and feel.  I probably should have looked closer but was expecting something more comfortable or cotton.  Great for a funny gift but not a great pair of socks."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T17:00:09Z,5,The perfect gift for the dog lover obsessed with their pet! High quality socks and the print was excellent.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T16:58:11Z,4,These were a big hit! The quality of the reproduction was very good but the size was much larger than an average woman's sock size and the fabric was a little stiff. Would order again as a gift since it was very well received.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T16:58:10Z,1,I never received my order. Every time I checked it said processing. It’s been a month. I have not received my order or a refund.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T16:58:05Z,1,Order never received.  Will not order from you again.   No shipping updates sent.  Total disappointment.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T16:57:26Z,3,The socks looked great in the end but took too long. Ordered three weeks before Christmas and they spent probably more than two weeks in production and then they were sent first class mail so they arrive about fours days after Christmas. I understand things take time but there should have been a warning that you need to order by a certain date to arrive in time.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T16:56:26Z,1,"This company did not send me the correct socks. I do not suggest using this company, I understand everyone makes mistakes but customer service does not even answer your emails in order to fix my order and does not have a phone number to call either."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T16:53:27Z,3,Quality wasn’t the best- ordered 2 pair socks- one pair came with a run in the material. Would reach out for new pair but email correspondence with the company  wasn’t the best  either.  I would not order again.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T16:53:02Z,2,"While these are cute with our dogs faces on them, they are not wearable. They are not shaped to fit human feet like any other socks bought in the United States. They are shaped to store a tube of tennis balls. Yes, they are cute. But no, will never wear them unfortunately."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T16:52:54Z,1,One pair of my socks were printed incorrectly. I reached out via email bit have not heard anything back.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T16:51:48Z,1,Never received my order.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T16:51:20Z,5,Thanks. Made a great gift.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T16:50:49Z,1,I can't review because I haven't received my socks yet. They were supposed to be a Christmas present...its now January and they still haven't arrived. When I ordered there was a promise for them to arrive in time for Christmas...so now what? I find it funny they want a review without confirming receipt of the product so this is what you get.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T16:50:31Z,1,"Ordered 2 pairs of socks as a Christmas Gift on 12/6, received an email on 12/12 that said the shipping label had been printed and shipping progress should show in a couple days, I've tried repeatedly since 12/15 to track the progress and it still shows that the items weren't delivered to the Post Office.  It's now been a month and all I've gotten is a form letter response blaming everything on the Postal Service.  Pupsocks has processed my payment but it's a month later and nothing. DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS OUTFIT!!!  IT'S A SCAM!!"
PupSocks,2021-01-03T16:49:31Z,1,My socks were a month late and someone else’s animal was printed on them. I emailed the company with my concerns and did not get a response. I am extremely disappointed  and dissatisfied.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T16:48:41Z,1,"no acknowledgment of the order. then the order just showed up more than a month later. i ordered a pair of socks with two cats, but received a pair of socks with one cat. that cat was not either of my two cats."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T16:47:40Z,1,"I never received my order. I place it over a month ago. I've sent multiple emails to the company, all of which have bounced. There's no phone number to contact customer service. I will never order from them again. This was supposed to be a special Christmas present for my husband, but it never arrived and I'm extremely disappointed."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T16:46:48Z,1,Ordered a month ago...still have not received my order
PupSocks,2021-01-03T16:43:58Z,5,My husband says this was his favorite Christmas gift this year!
PupSocks,2021-01-03T16:41:25Z,1,I ordered on December 6th. On December 18th i checked the status and it said they weren’t even produced yet. When i sent an email asking about the status i got some bs automated letter how high volume of orders would lead to a delay in responding and that everyone was experiencing shipping issues. I never got another response and the item wasn’t shipped until December 23rd. I still haven’t received my order.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T16:40:08Z,5,"Love this blanket! Bought for my daughter for Christmas with her cats face on it, and it was definitely a favorite gift and will be loved for many years to come. Thank you!"
PupSocks,2021-01-03T16:38:01Z,2,The socks look absolutely adorable but They  are not wearable!!!  The fabric is awful and they do not fit like any socks I have ever worn!! They barely go over the foot. So great look but they are only ornamental and cannot be worn to show off how cute they are!!!
PupSocks,2021-01-03T16:37:47Z,5,Love our socks! Happy customer
PupSocks,2021-01-03T16:34:31Z,1,"I ordered socks for a Christmas present for my son on December 6, 2020. As of today January 3rd, 2021, I still have not received them! After trying to contact this company several times, the only response I get is an automated email.  Terrible customer service.  This is no way to run a business."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T16:34:24Z,1,"I was excited to order these for my daughter, however, quite disappointed when they arrived. The picture barely resembled her cat, and the quality of the socks were terrible! Itchy, poorly designed, and although I ordered a small for her little feet, they were huge! Would not recommend, especially for the very high price!!"
PupSocks,2021-01-03T16:34:19Z,1,"I recieved the wrong order.  I emailed the company four different times, and recieved no response aside from automated responses saying they are incredibly busy. There is no telephone number listed so I had no other recourse.  I am so glad I paid with Amazon pay and hoping they are able to deal directly with the company on my behalf."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T16:33:18Z,3,Positive- the socks were great. Negative- I had written to customer service regarding a delivery issue and it took 12 days for them to respond.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T16:33:03Z,3,My socks came half out of the package and the sticker was stuck to the sick which pulled off part of the picture and ruined part of the blue on the sock. The other the photo was to black so you can't make out the face on the one cat.  I wish I had know so I could have uploaded another photo.  I really loved the concept and I would want to order again but would be worried about the outcome
PupSocks,2021-01-03T16:31:51Z,3,Shipping took quite a while (over 20 days) and I did not love the fabric of the socks. I gave them to my brothers for Christmas (I ordered at the beginning of Dec. and they still didn’t get here in time) so I haven’t personally worn them. They pictures looked cute through. I probably won’t order again.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T16:30:33Z,5,My daughter absolutely loves her socks and the picture was perfect of our dog.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T16:29:24Z,5,Great quality and fast shipping!
PupSocks,2021-01-03T16:27:52Z,3,"I probably should have chosen a better photo of my daughter's cat. However, it is obvious in the photo that the cat is not a tabby but appears as such on the socks. I've ordered from Pupsocks before, so this was disappointing."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T16:27:45Z,1,"They never shipped my order. They do not respond to emails, just and auto response blaming the post office. Looking online I found many people over the years have experienced the same and just had their money taken, no product or empty boxes. Seems like it’s true so far considering my card was charged yet my order never shipped."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T16:27:02Z,1,"I ordered a blanket with a cat’s face. The blanket that was produced did not match the picture I submitted. The blanket only contained the silhouette of the face and the eyes. The nose and mouth were not distinguishable like the picture. Additionally, my order took over three weeks to ship after I received a notification that the blanket was complete. I would not recommend PupSocks to another customer."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T16:24:27Z,5,"I bought a pair of these socks for my daughter’s boyfriend and they were a big hit. Had option to have two photos and they were shipped and received promptly, even during the holiday-pandemic slowdown."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T16:24:23Z,1,"Terrible service, still have yet to receive my product that was ordered On December 11th.  It appears to have been “lost” No number posted on the website to contact a person, sent a few emails that were sent back to me as undeliverable. Do not recommend ordering, had to report my card stolen because was sure that this was a bogus website. Tried to make my mom smile since we lost our dog in September and had to tell her I was scammed."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T16:23:24Z,5,I ordered several blankets as Christmas gifts. They were a huge hit! They turned out amazing and the quality of the blanket was even better than I expected.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T16:23:13Z,1,"Very disappointed. I submitted my order for two pair of socks. I uploaded two different pictures with a note asking if I could add both pictures. When I got the email confirmation, I realized that the system had not uploaded both pictures and I immediately emailed customer service. It took 3 business days and me emailing them to get a response and them basically saying there was nothing they could do as orders are immediately put into production (the order was placed on a Saturday and I doubt it was already in production and even if it was, the message on the order would have indicated to ask something to the customer). When I finally got the socks, one was correct, the picture pasted had my friend and dog. The other pair had the picture of my friend and dog cut and pasted separately which made the socks look weird. I definitely won’t order again for the mere fact that customer service could not have been bother to correct the second pair."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T16:21:24Z,5,"Great experience! This was a gift for my wife. Customer service honored a discount code following purchase due to customer error. Furthermore, while the shipment was delayed due to holidays/covid, a mock up was sent out, which I was able to show on Christmas. The socks showed up only a few days later in perfect condition."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T16:20:35Z,1,I ordered in November and now in January have yet to receive my order or any update on my order. When I attempted to contact the company I received and email back that their inbox wasfull and could not receive my email. I am unsure if I will ever see my order or be able to request a refund.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T16:18:07Z,1,I got one order made after the first order which never arrived.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T16:18:04Z,5,"I was thrilled with the transference!!!!! I asked for an accommodation w the picture I submitted and they were able to adjust accordingly. Through no fault of their own, I received much later than I anticipated. Next time I order I will do so in October versus December!"
PupSocks,2021-01-03T16:17:42Z,5,"The product turned out amazing! I ordered the large blanket and two pairs of socks as gifts, and each one the photos on the products were hilarious and super well done! My family loved their gifts.The only thing about the socks were that they are very smooth, and make walking around on wood floors a little slippery. I won't take a star away because of that, but just be aware!"
PupSocks,2021-01-03T16:16:45Z,5,Arrived quickly and my daughted loved her mask. They were able to include both our dogs and the backgroud is very cute. Will be ordering more in the future.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T16:14:16Z,1,"Absolutely horrible!! This is so ironic that PupSocks is asking me to review their product that I ordered on 12/6/20, was assured would arrive in plenty of time for Xmas, and still HAS NOT ARRIVED!! Have gotten a auto-reply response from company saying that covid has caused delays. This might be true within reason, but not for this long. The tracking number they provided me says that the package is still in pre-shipment.  Wish I had looked at the Better Business Bureau reviews on this company before I ordered as there are a TON of complaints. Will not order again.  Just want my full refund."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T16:13:19Z,4,"My friend’s sister was so happy to receive socks of her dog for Christmas. I also the blanket — in retrospect, wish I had gone with the larger size, but otherwise it’s lovely."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T16:13:01Z,4,"Gifting Stampy socks made my dad cry on Christmas morning, and he put them on immediately. I wish I could have known more about what the actual socks would be like, or have an opportunity to select from various styles of socks, but it probably also makes sense that they’re the way they are so that photos lay flatter"
PupSocks,2021-01-03T16:12:10Z,2,"I ordered our socks in mid November and only just received them a few days ago (early January.) I know the postal service has been very unpredictable this season and so I reached out three times to the organization to check in and never once received a reply back. I honestly had decided my money had been stolen and I wouldn’t receive the socks. I went ahead and purchased a different gift for my friend for Christmas. While I’m glad to receive the product and am excited for my friend to receive it I’m disappointed in how this was handled. Even if the socks had arrived this late, I would have given a higher score IF the company had reached out to me in response to one of my inquiries OR messaged in general to give me a heads up on shipping delays. Hopefully this can be a learning experience for the company as a whole."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T16:10:49Z,5,Purchase as gifts. Everyone loved them!
PupSocks,2021-01-03T16:09:30Z,1,"I ordered my socks Dec 6th, 2020 for a secret Santa item and as of today Jan 2nd I have yet to receive my item. Very disappointed and hoping they arrive at some point as per tracking they were not sent out until Dec 16th 2020 and only update I have received is “item is running late”."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T16:04:38Z,1,I still haven’t received my order that’s as placed a month ago. I gave also yet to receive a repose from customer service and I’ve sent two requests. Very disappointed.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T16:04:17Z,4,Socks were so cute! The socks are not cotton more of a nylon material.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T16:03:41Z,2,"The printing is cute but the socks are basically unwearable. They're structured more to be easily printed on rather than being structured like normal socks to conform to a foot. So the fabric bunches up on the top of the ankle and stretches awkwardly across the heel. My kids essentially said ""cute socks dad but I could never wear these."""
PupSocks,2021-01-03T15:58:10Z,3,"Perfect stocking gift for my husband! He was delighted and it has been a hit with everyone in the family! However, the downside is the quality of  socks. They are thin, shiny, and have a weird texture. It was still a great gift. Just not a great sock."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T15:57:33Z,1,Please send me this when I Actually receive my order.  It was supposed to be here before Christmas when I ordered it but I’m still waiting.  Hopefully it is not lost in the mail.  This was first my daughter and I was so excited for her to receive it.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T15:57:11Z,5,Socks came just like they said they were and they look really cute! My daughter love them
PupSocks,2021-01-03T15:56:31Z,1,I never got my order. No one in customer service responds
PupSocks,2021-01-03T15:56:18Z,4,"Cool socks. Loved them once they got here. They were the first thing I ordered, and the last to arrive, so my kids got them in New Year instead of Christmas."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T15:54:20Z,3,"There were a lot if issues with this order, and at first, no communication from pupsocks. I understand getting overwhelmed with orders this year, and, in a way, glad you had the volume u did. Eventually, everything was straightened out. I didn't recieve them in time for christmas, but that did not only happen with Pupsocks this year as many other companies were overwhelmed with online orders due to the pandemic. All that being said, my socks are great, my daughter-in-law loves them. Here's hoping everything goes more smoothly this year...for everybody!"
PupSocks,2021-01-03T15:54:03Z,1,"The blanket I ordered was terrible. Instead of my dog's face, there was a black splotch. They did not alert me or give me a chance to edit the blanket once the order was submitted. When I use other companies for this type of work, they always send a proof for me to approve. Had I known the picture of the dog would look so terrible I would have submitted a different picture. Now I'm out a lot of money with a terrible looking blanket. I also replied to their emails asking them to consider redoing the project with another picture, but all of those emails bounced back to me. So, the emails sent to their ""team"" address will be returned. Very disappointed."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T15:53:44Z,1,I paid $27 for what I thought would be a nice gift for a friend which was these blue socks with her kitten on them. After waiting 3 weeks she got the complete wrong thing which was these purple men’s socks with some random dog on them. I’ve written 3 complaint emails about the matter and it’s been 4 weeks since and still no one has responded. I do not and will never recommend pupsocks to anyone.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T15:51:37Z,3,The pictures rendered on the socks were great.  I was really impressed with the quality in that particular thing.The fit of the socks is not comfortable.  The heel seems to be poorly rendered and makes wearing uncomfortable.  They are only useful for the novelty of showing off the pictures.  Which does have some fun value.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T15:48:22Z,5,So cute did 2 dogs and they came out great love them
PupSocks,2021-01-03T15:45:02Z,1,I never received my order. I have emailed them numerous times and have not received a response. Would not recommend purchasing from this company.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T15:44:33Z,1,No phone number to call. No return emails to my messages. Wrong product sent. No response to my emails directly to team pup socks.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T15:44:15Z,5,Love the socks ! They are amazing !
PupSocks,2021-01-03T15:43:08Z,1,Terrible!  I have not received a response from customer service.  I have NOT received my order.  I have sent 3 emails re a refund and no response and no refund.Patricia Gustafson 507-236-8056
PupSocks,2021-01-03T15:42:01Z,2,"Product not received, even though order was placed in November. No refund given. Just told to wait for it to show when it does."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T15:40:50Z,5,"The socks arrived on xmas eve, after a long delay.Thank you for providing a response and reasons for the delay in shipping.Would highly recommend PupSocks to anyone"
PupSocks,2021-01-03T15:39:13Z,5,Bought my husband socks with our cats on them for Christmas. The perfect utilitarian gag gift! He loves them!
PupSocks,2021-01-03T15:39:07Z,5,The socks that I ordered turned out great. They were so adorable and they arrived in a timely manner. Could not be happier with my experience
PupSocks,2021-01-03T15:36:36Z,1,I wouldn’t even give them one star if it were an option. I placed my order as a Christmas gift on Dec 6th and the order still has not been picked up by USPS as of Jan 3rd.  I tried reaching out to customer service several times with no response.  In an automatically generated email Pupsocks is blaming the problem on USPS but they had seen this coming for a month now and should have switched to Fed EX or UPS since they have had complaints coming in for orders placed as far back as November.  There is no excuse for them to do nothing about it.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T15:34:59Z,5,Really cute socks!!!!
PupSocks,2021-01-03T15:34:04Z,5,Product came better than expected.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T15:31:45Z,1,I still don't have my order. I've emailed twice asking about it and I just receive an automated reply. Spent money on a Christmas gift that I never received.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T15:31:19Z,5,My son loved the blanket!  Thank you for fast production and shipping during the holidays!!
PupSocks,2021-01-03T15:30:02Z,2,"I ordered two pair of socks. One came as ordered but the other pair was incorrect. It was a dog when i ordered people faces. I’ve sent several emails and gotten no response. Well, I have gotten a response but its been a statement saying they have received so many emails and they would get back to me ASAP. Still waiting...."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T15:29:31Z,5,"My kids were thrilled with their blankets that have their kitty's face on them!  The cats enjoy them too!  Shipping was a bit longer than expected since they are metro to me, but such is shipping 2020."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T15:29:11Z,5,Brilliant fun product
PupSocks,2021-01-03T15:27:29Z,2,"I ordered socks as a Christmas gift for a family member. I have yet to receive them and it has been 6 weeks. The nice thing that PupSocks did was provide me with a mock image of the socks to give this person. But, when checking on tracking and shipping there is no sign of the socks to be delivered. It just says “processed”. This was unfortunate because when I checked out over a month ago it said 15 business days for delivery. This is likely due to the pandemic but even then know that it could be months before your order will arrive. Still waiting 6 weeks later, with no sign of shipment 😔"
PupSocks,2021-01-03T15:26:09Z,1,Haven't received order... Placed well over a month ago
PupSocks,2021-01-03T15:21:44Z,5,"My husband love , love ,  loves his socks. He wears them to his office  - always gets great compliments."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T15:21:12Z,5,"Socks came out great - three pup faces and all cropped perfectly and they were balanced nicely throughout the sock. Good quality. Fast shipping - delays were USPS fault, not the company!"
PupSocks,2021-01-03T15:20:59Z,5,Adorable!  Will order more in the future.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T15:20:13Z,1,Ordered mid November as Xmas giftfor my mother; but still not received - today is January 3rd.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T15:19:23Z,5,The quality is great and the picture was cropped beautifully
PupSocks,2021-01-03T15:15:34Z,1,"When my socks came they had the wrong dog on them. Communication with the company was absolutely terrible. They took a week to email me back and when I finally heard something about getting the correct socks it was just that they’re “on the way.” No tracking number or anything, so I still have no idea when they’ll come."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T15:14:13Z,2,"The socks are darling but the first time my husband put them on, they ripped in the heel.  The sock is designed more as a tube sock versus a regular sock which is not disclosed in the product description.  Not a good fit."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T15:14:13Z,5,Turned out great! Everybody loves their socks.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T15:14:08Z,2,The socks were very nice.  But I got the delivery after Christmas.  They were Christmas gifts.  I ordered them well in enough time.  And the order was wrong.  And it has not been resolved yet.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T15:12:04Z,3,My orders were kind of like a Pinterest fail. I would suggest emailing a proof before production. Perhaps suggestions on particular photos that will and won’t work.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T15:11:04Z,1,"The quality of these socks is so terrible. Imagine melting plastic bottles and then molding them into the shape of socks. Just a really weird, plastic-y fabric."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T15:08:19Z,5,Perfect! Better than expected
PupSocks,2021-01-03T15:08:02Z,1,Order took over 7 weeks to receive. Not worth the wait
PupSocks,2021-01-03T15:06:41Z,5,Both my mom and sister got a pair for Christmas. They both loved them.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T15:06:38Z,5,My wife loves it! Super soft and good picture quality.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T15:06:33Z,1,I ordered 2 pairs on November 24th. Still havent received them.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T15:06:08Z,1,I’m so disappointed in the quality of these socks. The picture of my dog is screened well so they look great. But the idea is to WEAR socks. The fabric of these socks is disgusting. It’s slick and has absolutely no shape. They don’t stay up on your legs at all. These socks were expensive! A total disappointment and a total rip-off. I wish I had looked at more reviews. I would never have bought this item.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T15:02:40Z,1,Originally I was thrilled with this purchase for my fiancé. Our dog looks adorable on the so ks and the tie-dye is hysterical. These socks were a size “XL” and supposed to fit men up to size 13.I am a slim female (size 8.5 shoe) and could not even get them on my foot/past my ankle. Deeply disappointed—I reached out asking for explanation/return instructions and received no answer several weeks later.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T14:59:17Z,2,"Socks are cute...but haven't actually seen them yet. Ordered early December for Christmas, it's now January 3rd and they are nowhere to be seen. :-(  They did not ship in the 8 - 10 day window stated on the website.  Would not order again."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T14:58:31Z,1,Very poor customer service throughout - even considering COVID. Socks look cute but are low quality overall and do not fit well. Not comfortable to wear and may only make an appearance a couple times per year.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T14:56:43Z,3,One of the blankets was wrong and did not include picture of both dogs.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T14:53:42Z,1,Didn’t receive my order.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T14:53:23Z,1,"Well it’s been over a month, and still no blanket or socks. Christmas has come and gone, and the only thing this “company” has done, is sent out a bunch of reassuring emails, that some day, I may get my product. I was banned from their FB page for repeatedly agreeing with the hundreds of others who got screwed too. Terrible people who won’t send you the product, and if you ask for your money back, the crickets get louder. 90 bucks down the drain. Thanks a lot PupSocks. You’re thieves."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T14:51:39Z,1,Still haven't received my order. Its been over a month and updates have been few and far between.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T14:50:49Z,5,Great gift!!
PupSocks,2021-01-03T14:50:39Z,1,The socks are unwearable. The cut is so far off that they’re absolutely useless. They’re big squares. No shape to them. ZERO possibility of actually being able to wear them. Huge waste of money.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T14:50:08Z,4,"I love the idea!  We did receive them a day too late, but I sent them on to my son-in-law, and he was totally happy with them.  Thanks for your service!"
PupSocks,2021-01-03T14:47:35Z,5,Got one for both my kids and the loved them ! Great shipping and notifications
PupSocks,2021-01-03T14:41:58Z,1,"The company did not send a preview picture of my socks until order was shipped.  I did not want bones or paw prints on my socks and I have sent over 5 messages to contact customer service or somebody to see if this could be fixed and NO response.  The absolute worst customer service I have ever dealt with.  All you get is an automated email response.  Do not order from this company.  Since I cannot get this company to respond, I had to pay for another pair of socks from a company on Etsy but they had a cheaper price, sent a picture of your socks for your approval BEFORE the were mailed and wonderful customer service."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T14:38:19Z,5,Great stuffing stocker
PupSocks,2021-01-03T14:37:13Z,1,"Purchased these at the end of November and it took until the end of December to get them. No one would respond to me on social channels, I only got one response back when I reached out to customer service and was overall really unimpressed with how they handled their business. It’s 2021. Choose a courier that WORKS or at least inform Canadian consumers of additional expected delays."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T14:36:05Z,2,Product was great but came way too late and after Christmas despite order being made more than an month before Christmas. Far too many spam emails. Even after I tried to unsubscribe.  (This survey for example)
PupSocks,2021-01-03T14:31:06Z,5,The socks I ordered for a dear arrived timely and were even more special than I thought they would be. The socks seem to be a good quality and the graphics were spot on! Thanks Pup SOCKS!
PupSocks,2021-01-03T14:30:56Z,1,Ordered December 3 - it is now January 3 and still have not received my order. It was a Christmas gift. I have no idea whether I will like it or not but I will not be ordering again because after a month of waiting I have given up that I will ever receive it.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T14:29:43Z,1,Horrible customer service. Socks are made of cheap material with no shape. Waste of money!
PupSocks,2021-01-03T14:29:08Z,5,The socks look amazing! They're good quality and the image doesn't get distorted when you put them on. Loved it!
PupSocks,2021-01-03T14:28:41Z,5,I've ordered socks twice and both times I was pleased. Good quality and love the choices.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T14:27:35Z,1,I ordered on 22nd November and I’m yet to receive the socks 6 weeks later. Christmas has passed and there has been no contact.I notice you’ve responded but want to confirm this hasn’t arrived. It’s now 10 weeks since I ordered. Awful service.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T14:25:02Z,2,"I ordered a pair as a Christmas gift on November 22 and, as of January 3rd still have not received them so I can’t comment on the quality.  I am disappointed in the chosen method of shipping but I do appreciate the customer service in sending email with a virtual e-card that I could share with the intended recipient to let them know a gift is on its way.   Looking forward to receiving them."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T14:25:01Z,5,"Even though I didn’t receive blanket until the day after Christmas,I was thoroughly impressed with the job you did.My daughter who lives away from home was really surprised and ecstatic to receive her blanket.She really misses her cats and now she can have them with her all the time.Thank You"
PupSocks,2021-01-03T14:12:04Z,2,"Socks not stretchy enough to wear comfortably , no stretch at the opening"
PupSocks,2021-01-03T14:10:32Z,5,"This blanket is soft and the color is great, plus the pic of our dog is amazing!"
PupSocks,2021-01-03T14:06:22Z,1,I still have not received my order which was a Christmas gift.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T14:04:10Z,5,An awesome one of a kind personal gift.  My grandchildren loved them!!
PupSocks,2021-01-03T14:01:15Z,1,"These socks were pricey and it was difficult to order them. I did finally get some assistance. I got two, one was an XL for my daughter who is a size 11 shoe. (I asked in a customer service chat about the size)They were too big. The other pair has two pulls in it. I don't want her too try them on because they will definitely cause holes. I reached out to the company to get this rectified. I received an email saying they were inundated with emails and were trying to respond. Still waiting. The pic of our pup is cute. Socks have no give to them. Not comfortable"
PupSocks,2021-01-03T13:56:21Z,2,Terrible quality socks for the price. Will not be purchasing again.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T13:51:39Z,4,The gift was really appreciated. The only little detail that bottered me was the croping of the picture I sent. Will choose a different kind of picture next time !
PupSocks,2021-01-03T13:50:47Z,1,Order placed Dec 5th. Still do not have my order. $162 worth of socks!
PupSocks,2021-01-03T13:47:19Z,1,"The item took over two weeks to ship from the factory, missing arrival in time for Christmas. The socks run extremely small, I ordered a men's medium and they do not even fit the recipient, my 10 year old. Overall extremely disappointed with the item and do no recommend - a waste of $30."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T13:46:03Z,4,"Socks showed up on time for Christmas. Looked descent, but I ordered the in blue and they showed up in white"
PupSocks,2021-01-03T13:34:32Z,1,I never received the socks. I got an empty bag with nothing in it.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T13:34:22Z,5,"These are my new favorite blankets!!! Super soft, great image quality, love everything about them!! I just wish they came in larger sizes now!"
PupSocks,2021-01-03T13:27:56Z,1,I can't really give this product any review as my package was delivered missing it's contents. I contacted Pup Socks but have not received a response other than a generic form email saying that they were very busy and behind. Aren't we all? This has been over a week and still no further contact except email advertising for me to purchase more items. I know this was a postal issue as well and we're all busy but that doesn't solve my problem.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T13:25:47Z,1,"I have not yet received my socks, have had no reply to the email I have sent . Poor communication. Poor service."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T13:19:53Z,1,Still not received ordered a month ago
PupSocks,2021-01-03T13:16:32Z,5,Love love love it ! So happy with how it came out. It was a gift for my daughter and she was so excited with it !
PupSocks,2021-01-03T12:57:25Z,1,"I placed 3 orders at the end of November and 2 orders in December and none were not received in time for Christmas.  I sent several emails without timely responses.  They were not ready for the influx of orders but kept accepting new orders. This company has no concept of customer service and should be ashamed of all of the people they took advantage of.When the socks finally arrived, the pictures are great but the quality of the actual socks is garbage.  Also, they charge your card as soon as the order is placed, as opposed to when the order ships, which is a shady practice."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T12:42:30Z,1,I have been waiting for over 6 weeks and still have not received my order.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T12:36:51Z,5,"The socks were better than I expected.  We got them for our kids, and they absolutely love them."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T12:31:31Z,3,"I purchased a few pairs for family and one for myself.  A big hit overall and the socks are from high quality material but they slide down in your shoe. This makes for an uncomfortable experience.  Maybe I would try a smaller size?  Is it the material they use? Not sure.  Again, bit hit and good quality so I would recommend with this caveat."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T12:30:39Z,3,Print quality is PERFECT but the the socks are...shaped weird? There's no shape to them at all so wearing the socks is a little uncomfortable.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T10:30:32Z,3,"The order was for Christmas and ended up arriving on time, however there was confusion regarding the tracking and shipment and I emailed and received no ""we tried but no answer"" to my question. Also, I ordered a mens size 13 sock along with 3 womens 8-11 for a four pack and I think all the socks that arrived were all the same size and no size was indicated on the actual socks. Also,  the communication I received said I was getting a mens 8-10 which I didn't order? Confusing. That said the order arrived- was darling and was a hit I just think the holiday schedule and contact info needs some work."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T07:26:21Z,2,"The picture was perfect but the texture of the socks was not comfortable, they were tight and very difficult to put on. I would have preferred cotton socks and stretchy, easy to put on and comfortable to wear all day. These were a gift and I didn’t feel good about giving these to her."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T05:57:37Z,5,"Nice socks, got here fast and looked good!"
PupSocks,2021-01-03T05:42:21Z,1,"Ordered item on  Dec 10. Item stated they would arrive before Christmas. Item was ""shipped"" on  Dec. 23. Item still at origin facility on 1.2.21"
PupSocks,2021-01-03T05:35:39Z,1,I ordered on December 5th. I have yet to receive my order.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T05:32:47Z,5,Socks were great. Wife loved getting them for Christmas. Shipping was right on time.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T05:30:32Z,1,Still have not received my order that was guaranteed fir Christmas.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T05:11:33Z,1,"Would not purchase again. Shipping took a long time, poor communication with customer and poor quality once it arrived"
PupSocks,2021-01-03T05:02:01Z,1,"I didn’t receive my order which happened to be a Christmas gift for my husband, still waiting. Ordered on 12/5 and wasn’t processed for almost 3 weeks."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T04:59:26Z,4,The socks turned out cute and the people I purchased them for loved them!
PupSocks,2021-01-03T04:59:05Z,1,I never got the socks yet I Oder on December 4 going to surprise my little 10 year old girl with the socks on Christmas... had a feeling I wasn’t going to get them so  I self made a t shirt so I can make my own stuff because I can’t trust or rely  on a  company I guess if you want something done right you just do it yourself .. thanks for the no surprise Christmas
PupSocks,2021-01-03T04:50:16Z,2,"I selected the four picture option -- when my blanket arrived, one of the pictures was completely blacked out (perhaps this was overlooked by their quality control?). I also attempted to contact customer service regarding the delivery of my purchase but never heard back. The blanket though is incredibly soft and I am happy with the 3 other pictures that were on the blanket -- hence the 2 star review."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T04:41:27Z,1,"Pup socks is a scam. Ordered December 5th, marked as shipped on the 8th. Today, January 2nd still have not received the socks. Save your money. These people are con artist and thieves. Had to call my CC to get my money. Then they try to give me 20% on next order. Whatever!  I will never send them another dime. Bunch of scammers. Sad to say they are in the US! Avoid this place at all costs!"
PupSocks,2021-01-03T04:37:55Z,1,"Terrible, terrible terrible customer service. The product turned out OK, however here is my issue: I ordered December 5, received it January 2 with a supposed 1-3 day turnaround. No communication whatsoever until I filed a complaint with PayPal then they emailed me and shipped it the next day. They blamed the Postal Service for the delay, however it’s set in their “production” for weeks without any notification to me before it was mailed. If you know that you are incredibly behind on production and that orders placed in late November and early December have no way of making it by Christmas, you should disclose that. This company has been in business long enough to know that honest communication can keep a bunch of angry folks from complaining and filing fraud claims.This company only returned my emails and phone calls after I filed a claim with PayPal to get my payment back.A look at social media shows hundreds and hundreds of angry customers who have not received their order, customers who have received the wrong order and no customer service communication.If you are constantly taking orders while promoting through advertising and social media that these are good Christmas presents, insinuating or even promising they will be here by Christmas day, however weeks go by with no communication it is irresponsible and dishonest."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T04:33:33Z,1,Very disappointed with my experience.  I placed an order for 2 custom face masks of my son’s puppy on December 5th thinking that 20 days would be plenty of time to receive this order in time for Christmas.  These masks were never shipped until December 18th.  I realize that COVID has caused all kinds of delays with deliveries with the USPS but as of 1/2/21 I still have not received these 2 face masks which were gifts for my son and his wife.  Will most likely never order from this company again!
PupSocks,2021-01-03T04:31:25Z,5,Socks look and feel great- the kids love them!
PupSocks,2021-01-03T04:17:02Z,1,"Order number 2461181Still have not received this order !!My Granddaughter aged 12 was so excited to order this for a Family gift a Blanket with her Dogs photo on it, and spent her own Babysitting money on it $ 78.70On Nov 30th here we are over a month later, and still no sign of it. This is disgraceful!! You keep advertising for new orders to be placed, but haven’t fulfilled previous orders.This is a scam !!"
PupSocks,2021-01-03T04:10:03Z,5,Cutest socks ever
PupSocks,2021-01-03T04:08:03Z,1,It is 1/2/21 and I still have not received the items I ordered 12/4/20. I have sent two emails to customer service and not yet received a reply.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T04:05:51Z,1,I havent received my order yet.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T03:54:26Z,2,One of my orders was missing a pair of socks and a month later I still haven't recieved the missing pair.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T03:44:06Z,3,"While the socks were cute, I felt that even according to women’s sizing that the socks were too big.  The material wasn’t soft, but almost plasticky."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T03:43:32Z,5,"Great product. My daughter in law will love her pup socks. That said, delivery got screwed up. The socks were delivered to me even though I edited the shipping address right after placing the order because my DIL’s address didn’t get saved in the order. Delivery was also late. Due for delivery 12/18 but didn’t arrive until 12/23. Disappointing since the shipping address was wrong and I had to mail them to daughter-in-law. Gift wouldn’t arrive until after the New Year."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T03:42:30Z,1,"Ordered 12/4/20 and was assured the socks would arrive in time for Christmas. It’s now January 2021 and still no socks. Tried emailing, calling, canceling my order to no avail. Would not recommend."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T03:42:10Z,2,Ordered on 21st November for Christmas present still not arrived.  I know we are in difficult times but maybe should consider not accepting international orders? I contacted customer services who did respond quickly so no complaints there.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T03:38:56Z,5,Just perfect!!!
PupSocks,2021-01-03T03:33:27Z,1,Still haven’t received ordered early December
PupSocks,2021-01-03T03:21:24Z,4,"your service looks good, but it looks like you got problems with delivery. I did 3 order  more than one month ago and I haven't seen one.I know it is hard with USPS so I'll keep being patient"
PupSocks,2021-01-03T03:03:33Z,1,I never received my order that I was charged for two months ago. There has been zero communication. It’s a shame really as your products look fun.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T02:57:47Z,3,Fabric was odd
PupSocks,2021-01-03T02:54:13Z,1,Never received item...keep receiving canned CEO response...seems like a scam...tracking info says fedex hasn’t received package...you say they have it...puts consumer in tough spot...ordered for Xmas...still hoping to get it some day...
PupSocks,2021-01-03T02:48:54Z,1,I was sent the completely wrong pair of socks. The company has yet to take any responsibility and they have ignored my emails for almost 3 weeks.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T02:48:27Z,2,"The quality of the blanket is great but I was very disappointed in the picture of my dog. My dog is a border collie and I was expecting some of his fluffiness to come through in the picture. Instead I ended up with what looks like a pit bull. One of your advertisements showed a golden retriever and I made my order based on that example. If that is not a true representation of your product, please remove it so other people are not disappointed like I was."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T02:30:38Z,1,I received the wrong order.  I ordered socks with my labradoodle on it and received socks with cats on them.  I emailed the company three times and each address I sent the emails to came back saying they could not deliver the message.  One of the email addresses was for customer service found on their website.  I don’t recommend this product and have had no refund.  Just brutal!
PupSocks,2021-01-03T02:12:10Z,3,"I really liked the color and the quality of the print was good, however the fit of the sock was not great. I got this as a present and it was tight at my husband’s ankles and loose at his toes. He enjoyed them though."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T02:12:03Z,1,Didn't get what I ordered.  And have not heard back from my email that I sent.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T02:09:08Z,5,My daughter loved her mask!! She said it was the best present she got!
PupSocks,2021-01-03T02:01:30Z,1,"I never received my order. Further, the mock up sent to me after Pucocks allegedly ""produced"" my order was of the incorrect item. This bad consumer experience was made exponentially worse by the fact that their support team never responded to my dozens of inquiries over email, Facebook and Messenger regarding my order. It seems like this is a pattern with Pupsocks. Not sure if this is some sort of scam, or if the company is just so poorly operated that they cannot fulfil orders. In either case, stay as far away as possible."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T01:54:21Z,5,"Love the socks, masks and blanket! They all came as ordered. My only complaint is that they were sent via USPS. I should have received them by December 22 at the latest since they were mailed 2 day priority December 18, but I got them January 2. The items were to be Christmas presents for family members who with me over Christmas weekend but I now have to mail some of them!"
PupSocks,2021-01-03T01:50:19Z,5,"I ordered pup socks for my daughter, daughter in law and my youngest son’s girlfriend. All with photos with their puppies in them . They were so surprised , and loved them!"
PupSocks,2021-01-03T01:48:08Z,2,"The socks arrived late (ordered Dec 5, came after Christmas) and the material felt so strange when they finally arrived that I probably wouldn't have gifted them anyway."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T01:42:03Z,5,Great socks!
PupSocks,2021-01-03T01:38:54Z,4,"Love the idea, the socks were delayed (no fault of theirs, the postal service couldn't keep up), and they look exactly like the mock-up :)  The company is a delight to work with and responded to all my questions.  I will definitely order from them again, just not for my husband...he's a good-sized guy and the socks hurt his calves ;(  But I will find someone else who needs some funny personalized socks!!!"
PupSocks,2021-01-03T01:26:42Z,1,"So here it is 1/2/21 & my order, placed on 12/5 & shipped 12/21, is still not here, although it was guaranteed before Christmas. Also, Pupsocks has still not replied to any of my many emails. Plus I'm still out the $139.57 that I spent on the order, even though my order is eligible for a full refund, per refund policy posted on the website. Had I known how Pupsocks operated, I’d have never placed my order. I feel I was duped & robbed by Pupsocks, a company more interested in profit than in honoring their guarantees. I’ve filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau, which publishes a grade of D for Pupsocks, due to the inconceivable amount of complaints against the company."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T01:26:14Z,2,"I recently ordered the pup masks for my husband for Christmas. They took a month to receive (I know that was more of the issues with the USPS currently) and when I got them today, the quality of the masks was lower than I anticipated. Despite the material being extremely thin, the elastic was the most disappointing part. It’s way too long. The printing of the images turned out lovely, the masks themselves are just poor quality and my husband told me that he wouldn’t be able to wear these to work as I originally intended. I also would like to mention that I’m a repeat customer, and when I tried to access my past account, I wasn’t able to and had to start a new account, which was a bit frustrating."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T01:22:46Z,1,I received my order Dec 30 and it arrived wide open and one of the items was missing.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T01:12:48Z,2,I still have not received this item that was ordered Dec 4.still shows in transit in GA. Was not happy to see your ad guanteeing delivering by christmas if you picked fed ex 2 day shipping or a refund would be given. That ad was posted in middle of dec. so now it is Jan 2 and it is still somewhere in Ga. I believe I should be compensated also. My grandaughter was quite disappointed.  Even items i ordered last minute were here by End of dec.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T01:01:48Z,5,"I bought a blanket for my step mom for Christmas, after she and my dad lost their dog, Maggie, over the summer. I put Maggie's face on it and it was absolutely perfect. They both cried when she opened it. I was a little bummed that I ordered it within the first week of December (I think the 4th) and it didn't arrive until the day AFTER Christmas but I understand they were probably super busy and they can't control the shipping process. Overall though, I'm extremely happy with my purchase. The quality of the blanket is great. It's really thick and soft and came out better than I expected."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T00:56:57Z,1,"Sent me the wrong blanket, I received the item for another dog. Also, there’s no customer service phone line, and my email about it has gone unanswered after 9 days."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T00:48:04Z,5,The blanket looked great and the turnaround time was fabulous! It made it here by Christmas! Definitely recommend!
PupSocks,2021-01-03T00:43:33Z,1,"I ordered this product at the end of November as a Christa's gift, and it never arrived. What a joke!"
PupSocks,2021-01-03T00:35:23Z,1,Received a request for a review and I still have not received either of my orders. Ordered well before Xmas.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T00:26:07Z,2,"I uploaded a photo of my boyfriend’s cat in a bow tie and submitted it to be printed on a blue blanket at the beginning of Dec.  Upon submitting, the shipping stated it would be here within 10 business days. By Christmas Eve it was still not delivered. Pupsocks did send an email on Christmas Eve stating they were sorry for the delay and showed a mock-up of what the blanket will look like, which I thought was sweet. However, after seeing the mock-up, I was disappointed. First, they cropped the bow tie off of my boyfriend’s cat. The background had dog bones on it (I’m pretty sure that’s my fault though. I thought they would leave those out if it was a cat but they do not.) Last, when I received it after Christmas, the picture of my boyfriend’s cat was extremely dark. I felt like if they had the time to crop out the bow tie, they could have lightened it if they knew it needed it. I will say that I bought the blanket on a great sale and there was another discount on top of it so that is why I gave it two stars."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T00:19:46Z,1,Too much advertising in all social media but can't respect the deadline for the order...still didn't receive my order...
PupSocks,2021-01-03T00:17:29Z,1,The order was placed on 11/29 and guaranteed delivery by Christmas.  I got it on 12/30.   The quality is horrible.  I would not order from this company again.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T00:16:21Z,5,I really like these socks.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T00:13:46Z,1,"Ordered 2 socks and a face mask on 12/5/20 for a Christmas gift for my wife of her recently deceased dog, which died in September that she got as a puppy 12 years ago. As of today 01/2/2021 I have yet to receive my order.  USPS has not provided an update since 122820 on its arrival or even its whereabouts.  I emailed PupSocks, and got a generic automatic response back which offered no helpful information.  So yea, pretty comfortable with the 1 star rating.  Cant totally blame USPS, they are always terrible, maybe its time to switch to Fed-ex or UPS for some efficient reliable delivery, especially when you charged me for shipping."
PupSocks,2021-01-03T00:10:55Z,5,my husband almost cried when he opened his blanket.  We had to put our dog down and this is an awesome remembrance of her.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T00:09:58Z,5,We love them!!
PupSocks,2021-01-03T00:06:53Z,1,Ordered December 4th and still am waiting for them. Still shows them in Georgia.  More then likely won't ever order again.
PupSocks,2021-01-03T00:05:08Z,1,I still haven’t received this and I ordered on December 2. Ridiculous
PupSocks,2021-01-03T00:05:03Z,5,Lovely socks. Used them to out both our kids and dog for my husbands stocking stuffer. Images were in great quality and size. The socks are also nice. They didn’t fall down off the leg or sag  when my husband wore them
PupSocks,2021-01-02T23:57:20Z,1,I have yet to receive my socks.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T23:50:46Z,1,Never received the order.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T23:49:26Z,5,"Although this blanket took forever to get to me, I am very happy with the quality and how the picture of beau turned out on it!  Plus the customer service people were excellent when I was wondering what happened to my order. Always answered my emails."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T23:49:08Z,1,"TERRIBLE! After several attempts of requesting a response.... I have yet to receive an email or message. The socks that were sent were not the ones ordered. I would never promote this business, but would definitely discourage everyone from placing an order with this company!"
PupSocks,2021-01-02T23:43:44Z,1,Wrong item sent with someone else’s pet. No response to multiple inquiries and it’s been over a week.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T23:41:20Z,1,I’m not sure what sizing chart is used but these socks are huge and the quality is poor. These socks are almost one inch wider than a standard medium sock. Since neither of these issues fall into the return policy I guess we’ll try and figure out another use for them. Maybe a stocking?
PupSocks,2021-01-02T23:40:19Z,1,"Over a month, and order still has not been delivered.  This was ordered for a Christmas delivery.  Poor Service."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T23:38:47Z,1,"I ordered a pair of socks on 12/5/2020 and I still do not have them as of today, 1/2/2021. When I questioned about my order via tracking, I just received a generic email about how the USPS has not been efficient. Don’t blame it on the USPS. They haven’t even been made; otherwise, they would show when I tracked my package. My package isn’t even traceable because this company hasn’t even completed the order. Very dissatisfied. At least send out a “customer service” email letting me know that they are taking longer than normal. If I wouldn’t have inquired about my purchase then there would of been no communication on their part. Very sad way to run a business."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T23:31:21Z,1,"While the printing of the dog/cat you choose is great, if you actually plan on wearing these socks I would strongly suggest you look elsewhere. These socks were clearly designed by someone who doesn’t know how the foot/ankle work and the fact that it, you know, bends. It results in a lot of bunched up material at the top of the foot where it meets the leg, and basically becomes extremely uncomfortable. My girlfriend put these on, as they were a gift, and then immediately took them off. I gave them a try myself and saw exactly what she was talking about, and solely wanted to warn any other future buyers that they aren’t truly getting a wearable sock."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T23:27:42Z,1,Ordered 1 month ago and still have not received product.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T23:25:57Z,1,"I ordered these socks back in November for a Christmas gift. Not only did they arrive after Christmas, they arrived damaged due to insufficient packaging. I am returning them, you’ll be paying for the shipping on top of a new pair. It’s disappointing since the design of them I was actually impressed with. In future, look into more secure packaging."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T23:24:55Z,1,"Socks were late. No big deal, I know shipping is crazy this year. But then I got a random pair of socks with somebody else’s dog (not my cat lol) Must’ve been mixed up in shipping. Customer service is so overwhelmed that they sent an email about how it will take awhile to get back to me, but it’s been a week and I still haven’t heard back yet. Novel idea but this company is just completely overloaded right now. I wouldn’t consider buying again until demand has died down in a few months."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T23:23:44Z,1,Never showed up
PupSocks,2021-01-02T23:22:11Z,1,"I ordered a pair of socks on December 5. It is now January 2 and I still have not received them. They offered guaranteed arrival within 12 to 15 days. I contacted the company to let them know and they basically passed the buck and offered no resolution. Ironically, my social media feed is inundated with multiple advertisements from pupsocks, guaranteeing quick delivery."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T23:05:28Z,3,"We ordered 5 pair of socks via 3 orders. The first 3 arrived timely. The socks were not sock material and don't have a sock shape (no heel, just a tube of fabric), but the image was clear and they were cute. The 4th pair arrived without incident. The 5th pair arrived with another animal on it (dog instead of cat). We e-mailed them about it. It took several weeks for them to respond and they were kind and apologetic in the e-mail. They asked for us to email them a picture of the socks we received, so I did that same day. We still haven't heard back from them. They were all Christmas presents, so 4 out of 5 ain't bad, but still, one gift not received kinda sucks."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T23:04:11Z,5,My wife’s face lit up when she saw her new socks and blanket. Just seeing that and listening to her giggling as she inspected all the faces made it worth every penny. The socks are really nice and the blanket is super soft. 10/10 would do again!
PupSocks,2021-01-02T23:00:37Z,1,Order was placed on Dec 3 or 4. Arrived Dec 31. Not happy but they are cute.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T23:00:00Z,1,I have yet to receive my single order of 1 pair of socks. The order was placed in early November.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T22:59:00Z,2,"They came in and the pics of the dogs were ok, but the socks that were supposed to be for my kid were huge. The foot part fit ok, but the legs are super baggy. She can’t wear them, and I spent $70 on them! Overall not happy at all."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T22:58:10Z,1,"My order was placed in November 2020 and was supposed to arrive from December 15th to 18th 2020, it's been 3 weeks since then and it still hasn't arrived. I reached out to support and didn't get a reply from them. Horrible customer service and a big waste of money. Really dissatisfied and disappointed."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T22:53:23Z,1,Still waiting for the gift I purchased on Dec 5th for my husband. It’s lost in UPS land since Dec 11th. 😔
PupSocks,2021-01-02T22:51:23Z,1,If I could give a zero star I would! Socks arrived but it wasn’t even my dog on the socks. A Christmas present ruined. Good luck getting through to their “Customer Service” as the only response is a auto generated email talking about the postal delays. NOT MY DOG! No phone number to contact. Going to be contacting the BBB! Grrrr 😡
PupSocks,2021-01-02T22:51:10Z,5,They were well appreciated by the recipients.  Much fun!
PupSocks,2021-01-02T22:41:23Z,3,"The placement of the pet faces were perfect. However, the socks themselves are not made properly. They are shaped like a flattened out rectangle, with no actual changes to account for an actual foot, so they bunch up in the front and are tight in the back. Not useable for actual wear."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T22:38:40Z,4,"Nice socks, print of dogs looked nice."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T22:36:47Z,1,I paid extra in shipping to get socks by Christmas and they were not delivered until after Christmas. Very disappointed that you took the money for shipping by Christmas and did not deliver. Won’t order again.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T22:33:41Z,5,Our grandson loved his socks and mask. They were well made and the pictures were very clear!
PupSocks,2021-01-02T22:30:50Z,1,The wrong item was sent to me and I can't get this problem resolved.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T22:28:48Z,1,"I’d give zero if I could.  Ordered a blanket with my dogs picture on it, after seeing numerous ads for the product.  It was to be a gift for my son; ordered on 12/2, shipping information was delayed but to be expected.  What I finally received 2 weeks later was a pair of socks with a cat on them.  I emailed the company several times to resolve the issue but received no response.  After 2 weeks of waiting, emailing and discovering countless experiences exactly like mine, I initiated a claim with PayPal for a refund (I had asked numerous times for a refund from the company as well) and the claim was closed in my favor on 12/31.  I did receive automated emails asking me to be patient and one from what seemed like a real person attempting to “fix” the issue after I filed my claim with PayPal, but the “fix” included my order fulfilled (right) or STORE CREDIT.  Then I got an email asking if I’d like to leave a review.  You got it, Pupsocks.  My review is that you’re a scam and I hope someone shuts you down."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T22:27:21Z,1,"I ordered two pairs of socks. One pair for my mother and one for my toddler daughter. However, they sent two adult sizes (instead of one adult, and one child like I ordered). These socks weren’t cheap and now I have a pair not in use."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T22:26:55Z,1,Not impressed.  I placed my order 11/05/2020.  They took the $$ from my account 11/06/2020.  I didn't receive the socks for over 6 weeks and they're poorly made.This was a gift for my daughter.  She's not impressed either.  Almost $30 wasted.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T22:19:11Z,5,"Super cute, well made and came quickly.  Perfect gift!"
PupSocks,2021-01-02T22:18:39Z,2,I would leave a different review but cannot as I have not even yet received the socks I ordered at the beginning of December.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T22:16:32Z,2,I would have rated higher but very disappointed that the order I placed on November 30th did not arrive until after Christmas
PupSocks,2021-01-02T22:09:14Z,5,Love the socks. Bought them as a gift and they love them as well. Dogs faces on the socks are perfect.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T22:01:06Z,4,I absolutely loved the socks!!!  I gave you 4 stars because one of the pair was the wrong size.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T22:00:19Z,5,Excellent quality and awesome detail. Pup Socks Rocks!
PupSocks,2021-01-02T21:54:16Z,5,These socks were a big hit! I was really impressed with the quality of the image and the speed with which it was completed. I would absolutely order from this company again. Thanks for helping make this holiday season a little more fun!
PupSocks,2021-01-02T21:38:15Z,5,These socks are amazing! I got them for Christmas for my daughter and had her new baby’s face put on them and they came out perfectly! Would definitely buy again and highly recommend!
PupSocks,2021-01-02T21:32:47Z,1,"Still haven't received my item that was ""shipped"" Dec 13th. Going from Atlanta to the suburbs in North Atlanta. Last I saw my package was in Florida on its way to Atlanta again. Emailed customer service almost 10 days ago and still no response outside of automated response. Still awaiting a Christmas gift and its January 2nd. Awful service, no response makes it even worse."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T21:30:11Z,5,"Came early, product was what was promised! What more could you want!"
PupSocks,2021-01-02T21:30:10Z,1,"I placed an order December 9th. I received a package December 24th. Not what I ordered. Still unable to contact them, nor have I heard back from them regarding my incorrect order."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T21:27:05Z,1,I’ve yet to receive my order that was placed in November.  Wonder if I’ll even receive the product.  Really disappointed as these were Christmas gifts.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T21:24:11Z,3,We have not received our pup socks yet...so can’t say much yet but looking forward to them
PupSocks,2021-01-02T21:20:52Z,1,The socks arrived so late and they were not even printed with the photo I sent. I sent in a photo of a dog and socks came with a bloody black cat on them !!!! Not very impressed.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T21:19:38Z,1,Order still not here.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T21:17:48Z,5,"My wife loved them!!! The pics I sent were already cropped to what I wanted but were cropped more. Not an issue, just thought the pics I sent would be used in their entirety.  Other than that, they are great!"
PupSocks,2021-01-02T21:14:54Z,1,"They literally don’t follow design notes at all. My dog looked like a completely different dog because they didn’t cut her neck into the picture like I asked. When I messaged them, I got no response. I’m not so sure I’ll be back to order again."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T21:14:51Z,1,I received a blanket that I paid $67 for with someone else's cat on it.  By reading other reviews I don't think this company just sends out a generic blanket with the same cats for every order.  Definitely a scam company.  Dispute the charge right away!!!
PupSocks,2021-01-02T21:12:44Z,5,"The blanket I initially ordered turned out so dark, you couldn’t see my puppy’s face. I thought they wouldn’t fix it. I was totally wrong! I emailed about it. They responded right away. I sent them a picture of the blanket they’d sent and a new picture. They apologized and sent a replacement right away! It turned out great. Definitely a fun item for any pet lover."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T21:09:17Z,2,"I ordered several items as holiday gifts. The two blankets were wonderful and my daughters love having the faces of their dogs on them. I also ordered masks. My husband’s mask is too small to be safe when worn in public and one mask was with a cute dog, but NOT our dog!!!I emailed to find out how to exchange masks, but am still waiting to hear back. (I understand it’s a busy time.)"
PupSocks,2021-01-02T21:04:06Z,5,Awesome company.  The first order was not right but they fixed it right away any I love them! Great quality!
PupSocks,2021-01-02T20:58:56Z,1,"Order was supposed to be for Christmas, was not delivered in time, when it showed up, the socks were damaged. Sent a. Email asking about a replacement. And got not answer."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T20:56:11Z,5,I bought these as a gift for my sister and she LOVED them!
PupSocks,2021-01-02T20:52:20Z,5,"Pup socks was able to help me get a unique and memorable gift for my wife. The blanket was custom created the the adorable faces of our pups that my wife loves to death. To top it off, I was able to get it in time for Christmas!"
PupSocks,2021-01-02T20:52:08Z,5,Second time I’ve purchased from this company. They never disappoint. Good quality and so unique. Would definitely recommend to everyone.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T20:51:06Z,5,I loved how they turned out and the people that received them as a gift loved them too.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T20:50:25Z,2,"Really disappointed in the material quality and shape. I get they’re “funny” socks, but design and material make them basically unwearable. Would not purchase at that price point."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T20:49:00Z,5,The socks were a gift for my nephew and his wife. PupSocks was able to include everything I asked for and they turned out so good! The kids loved them!
PupSocks,2021-01-02T20:45:24Z,5,"These are so great, I am even more impressed in person. 10/10"
PupSocks,2021-01-02T20:45:23Z,1,Unfortunately your product looked nothing like the picture I sent.  The color was completely different; my cat is grey but you produced an orange cat.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T20:43:49Z,1,I have never received my order. Never received.  Please Help me!!  No response from my emails.  [Order #2490671]
PupSocks,2021-01-02T20:43:21Z,1,Received the wrong socks after a 3 week delay on shipping. Impossible to get in touch with customer service after multiple email attempts. No phone number listed.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T20:38:45Z,1,"Socks are terrible quality. My husband could barley get them on. Not sure what the fabric is but very uncomfortable, stiff and itchy. Design was awesome but he can’t even wear them so what’s the point."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T20:37:08Z,1,I ordered two pair of socks on Nov 21 and still have NOT received my order. Very disappointed.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T20:36:13Z,3,"The printing quality was great and they did a god job on copying the dog's face. However I didn't like the quality of the socks. They felt like compression stockings, a lot of polyster spandex. The person I gave them to as an Xmas gift though they were not nice quality either."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T20:30:24Z,1,Never got my product after almost 2 months
PupSocks,2021-01-02T20:29:55Z,3,The pictures are great but needs softer material
PupSocks,2021-01-02T20:29:14Z,3,"These socks took a month to arrive; that may not be pupsocks fault. However, I was disappointed with the color (different than pictured), fabric (silky), and fit (insanely wide socks for both the adult and kids sizing). Will not order from this company again for the price (approx. $23 on sale per pair x3 pairs) .  The actual image of the dog’s head looks nice."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T20:25:06Z,1,I have yet to receive my items I ordered for Christmas or even an update as to where it is. I emailed the company on 12/25 and still have had no answers or response. This has ruined our Christmas for 2 of my children who are still waiting on their gifts.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T20:24:17Z,1,Only shipped when I filed a claim. Then shipped WRONG ITEM. I’m now waiting for a response and are working with PayPal to get a refund. Terrible communication and terrible service.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T20:22:23Z,5,I bought these socks for my son as a Xmas gift.  He loves them  You kept me well informed as to delivery!!!!  Love this gift.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T20:22:22Z,5,They did a great job - so cool! Five Star Product. I was going to give a bad review - promised to arrive before Xmas - and no - a week late... Blaming it on the USPS but did not ship for over 20 days. But their quality is better than their service!Did not disappoint!
PupSocks,2021-01-02T20:21:33Z,1,I still have not received my order and it has been over 4 weeks.  This was a Christmas gift and at this point I would just like it to arrive.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T20:21:25Z,1,Still waiting for my order!!!  I’ve emailed never received a response.  I have now idea when my order will arrive.   Pupsock said it shipped and ups doesn’t have the product.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T20:19:48Z,1,If I can put 0 stars I would.  Still have not received the package or an email stating that they have been shipped. I have contacted customer service for a tracking number more than once and they haven't provided me with one and evaded my question stating due to Covid....meanwhile I received a package from China within a week.  Doesn't make sense. Extremely unhappy.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T20:15:38Z,1,"Horrible, I never received my order from 12/2, you don’t answer emails or messages, total scam!"
PupSocks,2021-01-02T20:14:43Z,3,"The socks are cute, but I thought I was ordering 3 with my dogs’ faces on them. It turned out to be 1 with their faces and two with a yellow lab’s face (I don’t have a yellow lab)!"
PupSocks,2021-01-02T20:14:14Z,1,I’m very frustrated and disappointed. I received what I thought it was my order on Dec. 20th and from that day on I’ve send several emails receiving only automated reply without actual information about my order.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T20:14:05Z,1,"I bought these for my husband for Christmas. They didn’t arrive until the day after. Probably my fault for not ordering in time. But if I had known, I wouldn’t have ordered. Very, very disappointed in the quality of the socks. They don’t feel like socks, just some kind of fused together fabric, not sure it’s anything I’ve ever seen before. Very expensive for what I got. Even the novelty aspect isn’t worth $26 a pair. Don’t recommend."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T20:13:13Z,2,The socks are cute but they’re not shaped to fit an actual human foot. They go across the toes in a straight line as if every toe is the same length. This causes extra material to bunch up at the end of the sock. Because the sock is shaped like a tube extra material also bunches up at the ankle making it very uncomfortable. They are basically unwearable. It’s too bad because the idea is a good one.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T20:07:04Z,4,"Fast shipping, images look great! Super nice photo quality. Socks themselves were pretty big, but still happy with them. Thank you!"
PupSocks,2021-01-02T20:06:53Z,5,"The blanket I ordered for my sister turned out better than imagined! She absolutely loves it! Soft, comfy material with the cutest dogs face!!"
PupSocks,2021-01-02T20:05:33Z,5,Super cute gift for my 14 year old niece! She LOVED them!
PupSocks,2021-01-02T20:01:56Z,5,Good quality socks. Great job snipping the animals faces. Wife LOVED them.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T19:54:13Z,1,"I had 2 separate orders. One was socks and I got them. The second was a blanket that was supposed to be with my daughters dog on it, instead I got a strangers cat. I’ve tried several different times to contact you and of course no answer. Next time I order from a Facebook advertisement I’m going to read BBB reviews first. Your company has terrible reviews and I understand why now. I will never order from you again. Be prepared to hear from PayPal or my bank to correct this. You are a fraud."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T19:43:40Z,1,I have never even received my products after more than 20 days. Nobody will even get back to me after I  spent almost $100. I won't be back.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T19:35:57Z,5,"I bought the large blanket for my son and his cat for Christmas. He laughed so hard when he saw it but LOVES it!  Himmy does too, even if he is trying to figure why his big head is all over it."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T19:33:03Z,3,Socks are fun.   Quality is ok. They are gifts so I haven’t worn them personally.  Shipped via USPS.  Big mistake.  Ordered 8 pair.  Got 2 so far.  In two separate packages.   Who knows when I will see the rest.  Ordered 3 weeks ago.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T19:27:09Z,1,Socks are like bags on your feet. No shape at all. Piece of crap from China
PupSocks,2021-01-02T19:21:24Z,2,The mask is so skimpy and poorly made that it will not be wearable. I’m sorry I spent so much money on this . To make matters worse it was a Christmas gift and it just looks like it cost nothing at all
PupSocks,2021-01-02T19:20:50Z,1,Finally received package (over 4 weeks ship time)however 1 pair of socks belong to someone else. Someone else’s dogs!I’ve tried reaching out several times and nobody has replied back to me.Very disappointed with the error. More disappointed with the lack of response.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T19:19:39Z,5,"This was a perfect gift for my sister. I was able to have each of her 4 dogs printed on this super soft blanket. I think that this may have been one of her favorite Christmas gifts. This did take several weeks to arrive which makes sense as it is a custom product. My only criticism is that when I contacted customer service to check on its possible arrival, all they would say or could say was that it was in process. I would have liked there to be a better way to either be able to log onto my order to see the progress, like some major pizza chains do or at least have the company reps have access to up to date knowledge of where my order is in process. Since this was a Christmas gift that arrived Christmas week, I was concerned that it would not arrive in time so I ended up going out to buy additional gifts that I might not have done. This is a beautiful blanket and my sister loves it! Thank you very much"
PupSocks,2021-01-02T19:17:26Z,4,"The socks were super cute- the pictures came out perfectly! The material is a bit strange, but my son loves them anyway."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T19:10:37Z,1,"Please cancel my order and issue a prompt refund for this order as I have YET to receive it. It is no longer needed and I have found another company to do this for me. I placed this order the same day as another order, order #2472720. I received that order, but this one only shows it as ‘In-Transit’. I placed this order one month ago today. When I reached out to ask about it a couple weeks ago before Christmas, I was blown off. This was poor communication and customer service and will certainly be remembered in the future and when I tell people of my experience. Again, please cancel my order and issue a refund immediately. Thank you."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T19:09:10Z,3,"I've purchased these socks as a Christmas gift for my husband for the past 3 years. I was happiest with the results of the first year, but these last 2 pair weren't great. I was specific with how I wanted the photo cropped by your people. I asked for the cutoff to be at my dog's collar so it wouldn't look strange. My request was not satisfied. The socks are just OK. Would be a lot nicer if it was cropped properly. Probably will go with another company next Christmas."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T19:08:52Z,5,Got these CatSocks (and masks) for my daughter and her boyfriend.  They said they were the best Christmas gifts they got and the products are super comfortable along with being cute!!
PupSocks,2021-01-02T19:07:21Z,5,Just the way I wanted them to look!
PupSocks,2021-01-02T19:05:46Z,1,"Sock quality was poor for price.Pet pictures were poor.Ordered 12/3, but not delivered in time for Christmas.  While I accept this was the USPS fault, you did not provide any communication and continued to market your product without disclosure to new customers."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T19:01:55Z,1,"I was sent the wrong pair of socks,  sent an email to the company and have yet to hear back."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T19:01:45Z,5,They turned out great! My wife loves them.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T18:58:51Z,1,"Unfortunately, the quality was pretty poor. We had 4 different color socks and my dogs face could barely be seen. Would not order again."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T18:57:46Z,1,"DO NOT ORDER.  I ordered 4 pairs of socks On Nov 21st, 2020.  I still haven't received them.  I'm wondering if this is actually a complete scam.  PupSocks provided a tracking number, but the package never actually makes any progress in shipping.  Also, no available customer service at all - they never returned my email and there is no phone number.  I should have looked closer before ordering this product.  DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS SITE."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T18:57:06Z,1,Ordered two pairs of socks and only received one pair.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T18:56:46Z,1,Haven't seen the product yet. Ordered  4 blankets and socks and was expecting products before Xmas. Pupsocks gave us a tracking number but USPS never received product to ship and now we are into Jan. Would not recommend. Plenty of other companies doing this cheaper.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T18:55:55Z,1,We received the wrong blanket 😡
PupSocks,2021-01-02T18:52:54Z,5,Great socks came on time as expected. Got 2 dogs photos on them for my daughter she loved them.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T18:48:59Z,5,Great product delivered on time .
PupSocks,2021-01-02T18:47:13Z,1,"I have tried contacting 3 times, no response. My order is defective. It was a Christmas gift, did not see the big defect before giving it. Very upsetting and embarrassing."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T18:46:17Z,1,It's been a month.  Still don't have the socks.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T18:46:10Z,4,"The image quality is good and the socks are really funny. However we purchased them for a man, and, while the foot size is perfect, the sock is to narrow on the leg. We had to cut part of it to be able to use the sock."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T18:46:06Z,5,These were a gift and all were pleased
PupSocks,2021-01-02T18:43:44Z,1,Ordered over a month ago and have not received them. Only update I’ve had was a pre-shipment notification Dec.12. When I contact customer service all I get is a form letter reply. I’m very discouraged.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T18:39:38Z,1,Sent the wrong size socks. Also the material is cheap.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T18:38:57Z,1,Do not buy from this company! We ordered on December 4th. Received a notification that they shipped on December 11th. But the post office never received it. When you email them you get a generic response blaming COVID but when you research the company they have been doing this for years. There is no phone numbers. Please please please do not waste your time or your money with this horribly run company!
PupSocks,2021-01-02T18:37:59Z,3,"I'm only giving you a 3 star, due to I ordered my socks for a Christmas gift on December 5 and still have not received them.  I'm hoping this website is not a scam. I'd love an update.  Your socks are not cheap in price!"
PupSocks,2021-01-02T18:37:58Z,2,I placed an order for 5 socks.  3 blue 2 pink 1 white.  I got 3 pink 2 blue 1 white. The order came after Christmas and I was charged for two faces and all the socks o my had one face on it
PupSocks,2021-01-02T18:37:46Z,2,"Ordered socks on December 2, it is now January 2 and still have not received them."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T18:35:04Z,5,Looks great! Very pleased.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T18:34:33Z,5,Reeva who answered my inquiry regarding my order was so nice and couldn't have been more helpful. I can't wait to receive my order!
PupSocks,2021-01-02T18:34:17Z,1,I ordered my pupsocks in mid-November and still don't have them.  So right now I am not a happy pup.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T18:33:55Z,5,I ordered a blanket with 2 cat faces. Unfortunately when it arrived one of the cropped cat faces looked horrible.  I reached out and was worried I would get no response.. quite the opposite! I received an email saying they would correct my blanket and send a new one. The replacement blanket is adorable and was a favorite Christmas present for my kiddo. Thank you for making it right!
PupSocks,2021-01-02T18:33:27Z,2,Sent package without contents in them. Reached out via email because they do not have a listed number on website.  They never got back to me until I opened a case via PayPal.  Once that happened they contacted me and wanted proof.  After proof was sent I waited 2 weeks before getting them. They were a Christmas gift.   It took less time to get them the first time then for them to reship them.   I told them it was a Christmas gift and they said they didn’t care.   Be careful.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T18:32:37Z,1,I never received them.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T18:30:31Z,2,"My order was purchased November 21st. It didn’t even arrive to the post office till after Christmas. And now the delivery is delayed again. Overall, disappointed because I can’t blame the post office when they never received the order."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T18:26:50Z,1,"I ordered my socks 12/5 and still haven't received them. I've emailed pupsocks numerous times with NO response. 5 kids did not receive their presents. tracking still shows that only a label was generated on 12/11. The socks never even made it to a post office so...where the heck are they? You suck, pupsocks...DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T18:25:08Z,4,Super cute. Husband loves having socks with Rigby’s face on them!
PupSocks,2021-01-02T18:24:39Z,1,Never received them.  Terrible
PupSocks,2021-01-02T18:23:22Z,5,Gave the socks as a Xmas gift and my friend and she said it was THE best Xmas present she received. She loved the customized socks with her precious pup on it.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T18:23:03Z,1,"I still have not received my order from nearly a month ago, and I am still awaiting a response to my follow-up e-mail regarding the order status."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T18:22:54Z,1,I have never received my socks. I ordered in plenty of time for Christmas. The shipping label was created December 13 and still is sitting there. So so disappointed
PupSocks,2021-01-02T18:22:08Z,1,The picture of the finished product is very cute but that’s all I’ve seen so far... I ordered two pairs of socks a month ago and still have not received them.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T18:20:57Z,1,Literally never shipped my socks. Waste of $35
PupSocks,2021-01-02T18:19:03Z,5,The blanket is so cool!  Love it
PupSocks,2021-01-02T18:10:29Z,5,The person who got this gift loved it!  Loved the Bomba socks too!
PupSocks,2021-01-02T18:09:38Z,1,"Ordered a month ago, still no sign of my order.  Understanding of the USPS debacle, companies have numerous other options to distribute and ensure their products are not only made on time, but delivered"
PupSocks,2021-01-02T18:07:12Z,1,"I ordered a pair of socks, but the pair that arrived weren't the right ones. I could not find a phone number to call so I sent an email through the website to get it sorted out. I have not received a response to my email but I certainly have a lot of emails offering discounts for future purchases."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T18:06:57Z,5,Every aspect of PUP socks was wonderful
PupSocks,2021-01-02T18:05:26Z,1,I have to be honest.... I placed my order on December 4th and purchased socks and a blanket.  I have not received anything yet and I am very disappointed.... it was a Christmas gift and now I am worried I paid a lot of money and it’s not coming.  I would def hesitate to ever order with your company again.  Please let me know if I am getting my item or Not.  Thank you
PupSocks,2021-01-02T18:01:25Z,5,"Amazing socks! They were a gift and one of the biggest hits on Christmas morning! The fit is great, more like a dress sock but still very comfy! Highly recommend these!"
PupSocks,2021-01-02T17:54:14Z,1,Not sure why you would ask me to review a product I ordered on 12/5 and now it’s 1/2 and I STILL don’t have. I have attempted to contact your company multiple times via email and Facebook since there is no phone number to cal and have not heard a word from you. You had no problem taking my money immediately for a product that I still don’t have...this is joke. DO NOT BUY!!
PupSocks,2021-01-02T17:54:00Z,2,"Customer service was severely lacking. I can handle the late shipping, considering everything going on in the world and it being the holiday season. However I never got a timely response to my inquiries, and when I did they were obviously pre fabbed responses. It never actually referenced the question I asked twice.  My blanket came in an almost completely opened bag, which could have happened in transit, but the shipping bag also felt cheap and thinly made, it also had no packing slip. The blanket itself is nice enough, thinner than expected but the print is nice."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T17:50:28Z,3,I wish you had tips for a good photo or allowed us to see the cropping before final product.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T17:49:06Z,3,"Socks are basic, non-conforming.  Pictures came out good.  Just wish socks were better quality.  Also ordered a medium for size 8 women feet and were way too big."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T17:46:32Z,1,"They took a long time in “production”. They were cute, although one of my 4 was wrong. Most uncomfortable socks I have ever tried on. They have no heal so it bunches up on the top of your foot. Also the toe box is straight across so there is a bunch of extra fabric over the outside of your foot.  Basically what you get is an expensive tube of crappy fabric with your adorable pup all over them."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T17:44:54Z,2,"The socks look great, but are very uncomfortable. Still a great gag gift though."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T17:44:28Z,1,"I haven’t even gotten my order yet that I ordered a month ago. Every time I have emailed I didn’t get a response until at least a week later. I needed my gift by Christmas and it was said that it was guaranteed to come by then, but I still don’t have it"
PupSocks,2021-01-02T17:42:54Z,1,"I ordered a blanket and socks on December 5 and still have not received my order. I understand that things run behind, but the website said anything ordered before December 12 would be delivered before Christmas. Today is January 2 and I still do not have my order."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T17:42:17Z,1,"1.  The order received was completely incorrect2.  I do not like the quality and material of the socksI submitted, requested and paid extra for 1 pair of yellow socks with 2 cat faces to be printed. Instead I received two pairs; one yellow with a picture of only one cat and another pair of white socks with a picture of an unknown dog.  Did I receive someone else’s order in error???  In addition, I do not like the texture and quality of the socks.  Due to both of these issues, I am not interested in a reprint.  I have submitted 3 requests asking for a full refund and instructions on how to send back for this to be completed. To date I have not received a reply. There is no other way of contacting this business in terms of a phone number.  I will never order from them again and plan on filing a complaint with the Better Business Bureau if I do not receive a response within the next few weeks."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T17:41:53Z,1,"Horrible.   Ordered on12/4 or so,and have received nothing except the same cookie cutter shipping notice that seems everyone gets, and now you want a review?  My rating is zero, poor, F... I am filing a case with the BBB and other places so no one has to go through this!  😡"
PupSocks,2021-01-02T17:41:42Z,5,Order came in on time.  Socks came on time with pictures being cropped perfect.  This was a great gift.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T17:41:28Z,1,"The socks are a super weird uncomfortable material that don’t really fit right and are hard to get on and off. I bought the 10-13 size and wear a 11.5 shoe size so I purchased the correct size. On top of that, the wrong socks were sent so I now have a pink pair of socks with someone’s cat on theme."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T17:37:54Z,1,"It took longer than the stated 8-10 business days to receive my order. In fact, my order had not even shipped in that time. I emailed the company about it and they conveniently blamed it on USPS. What? Clearly the bottle neck was on their side. Once we got the socks, we were disappointed with the quality of the sock. Shapeless and with little stretch. It isn’t shaped like a sock at all. The only highlight was that Pupsocks cropped our pets head image well so kudos to their design team. If you check out their Instagram account, tons of complaints about their customer service. Also, they look like a get rich quick/fly by night  company. Outdated copyright year in their footnotes, way too many website popups to get you to buy. And god forbid you try to unsubscribe from their emails. 4 attempts later and I am still getting unwanted emails from them. Not buying them again."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T17:35:53Z,5,The socks turned out so great! Clear picture of the cat and my friend loved them!
PupSocks,2021-01-02T17:34:01Z,1,"I am very disapointed with my experience. I was so excited to do business with this company. I have placed my order a month ago and i have NO news at all. I tried sending emails, used the chat service on the website. The tracking info has not been updated for weeks. I have no news except an automatic reply from the ''CEO'' (they send it out every time you send an email saying they have a COVID backlog...). I have no clue where is my order and i am not getting any replies or news from the staff or company. Very bad customer service for replies. I am very worried about this order and service overall as I spent money and still have nothing in return."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T17:32:48Z,3,My socks arrived timely and are cute. The only dislike I have is that one ear was cut off. It would be nice if you could preview the item prior to purchase so you could chose a different photo so it could better.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T17:31:01Z,1,I still have not received my product.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T17:30:18Z,1,"Even though the product turned out fine the overall experience was terrible. The time it took to make one item was way longer than the 8-10 days it said it would take, shipping took even longer and when I tried to reach out to their customer service (Twice) I didn’t get a response at all. I ordered this item in the very beginning of December for a Christmas gift and it didn’t arrive January. I would never order from this company again or recommend them to anyone."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T17:28:20Z,5,My children’s faces were priceless when they opened up their Xmas present from our dog!❤️
PupSocks,2021-01-02T17:27:28Z,3,The socks were really cute but very uncomfortable. The don't bend at the ankle very well... very stiff.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T17:26:32Z,1,"Cute, but not a quality sock.  No real fit to them.  Toe bed just stitched straight across.  Expect more for what they cost."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T17:26:09Z,1,Received someone else’s socks. No customer service phone number and haven’t received a reply to message I sent in 2 weeks. Do not order
PupSocks,2021-01-02T17:25:28Z,1,I ordered this blanket on December 5th and it is now Jan 2nd and I still do not have the product. I have tried writing the company twice with no responses. Worst customer service I have seen!
PupSocks,2021-01-02T17:23:44Z,1,Ordered on Dec 7 and still have not received as of Jan 2. No communication. Worst Christmas idea ever.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T17:21:49Z,1,Order still not here (in “preshipment” since 12/11/2020). No response from customer service to my multiple requests for refund.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T17:20:54Z,1,My order wasn’t shipped for 10 days after it was placed.  And then. It was placed with the usps on 12/16.   This would have been fine if the world didn’t already know USPS was not delivering timely- my package should have been fed ex at that point to make Xmas.    When I did receive my package after Christmas - it was the wrong order!!   Instead of the puppy it was someone else’s cat! Feel bad for that customer as well.   It has now been 7 days and still no reply to my email .   Terrible.     And I paid what I perceive to be a lot of money for those novelty socks!
PupSocks,2021-01-02T17:20:54Z,1,"well, since PupSocks asked for a review, my response:Still have not received the order.  We placed it for Christmas gift, 4 weeks ago, and nothing has arrived.No communication, until we contacted them, and then pablum.Very disappointing experience."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T17:17:53Z,2,the mask is a little flimsy for my preference.  size is too small for adult. I'm wondering if I ordered the wrong sizeable. it took 4 weeks to receive.  I've ordered with you before and never remember having to wait on an item. I have loved your items in the past. I hope this mask issue is just bad luck this time.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T17:17:08Z,1,I still have not received my product so I would give no stars if I could because it was supposed to be a Christmas gift
PupSocks,2021-01-02T17:15:54Z,1,I ordered a blanket for my daughter on December 5 and still have not received it. The tracking has not been updated since December 22 and says it is still in the Atlanta post office. Tried emailing the company and they say it is USPS fault for accepting so many packages. So frustrating.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T17:15:53Z,1,I placed a order December 4th. I got a updated that it shipped on December 11th with a tracking number but it never went anywhere.  It is January 2nd and I still haven't received the Christmas gift I got for my boss.  I have emailed the company 2 times and haven't had a response.  I would NOT recommend purchasing.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T17:15:30Z,1,Original orders had to be re-ordered and re-done. Still have not received either order. Both were placed late november/beginning of December. Could not get a response after numerous calls and emails.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T17:14:36Z,1,"My order took three weeks to deliver. When I received it it was wrong. I ordered dog socks, not cat socks (which is what I received). I have emailed about this both through their website and Instagram and I have not received a reply. I will not recommend this site."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T17:14:23Z,5,"Great customer service! I received an empty package, socks must’ve fallen out in route. I emailed the company and within 48 hours, I had a response and no questions asked, put another pair in production and had it sent to me!!Will highly recommend"
PupSocks,2021-01-02T17:13:53Z,1,"It took a month to get the WRONG socks for $35, like they pulled a pair off the rack and shipped whatever. When I did get them they also put a generic note from the ""Postal service"" saying sorry for the delay that package was damaged and found lost in the mail, but the package was from pupsocks and in normal condition. I emailed the company and they sent another generic email apologizing for the delay but never addressed the wrong order, that they process thousands of orders a day as well as email, doubt it, still haven't heard back. I just want to return the socks and get my money back, btw the socks were a picture of my Dad who died a few months back w/ our black lab who has been gone for a while now such a disappointing experience w/ this."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T17:12:45Z,3,"Asked that the fluff around his face was included as he is a siberian. They did not do, so looks more like a tabby. Good quality though"
PupSocks,2021-01-02T17:11:11Z,1,"I received someone else’s pup on my socks, have emailed 3 times with no response ☹️ I have a disappointed little girl at home..."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T17:10:40Z,3,I purchased gift wrapping for like $7 but it only comes in an open faced gold tray. Not what I expected on an already expensive gift.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T17:10:40Z,1,Still have not received my socks. They were ordered 28 days ago. Can’t say what I think of them. Why ask me to rate something that hasn’t been delivered yet? Tracking said it made it to town yesterday but who knows when it will it will come. Terribly expensive socks
PupSocks,2021-01-02T17:10:21Z,5,So very cute!  Love them!
PupSocks,2021-01-02T17:09:35Z,3,Loved the product very much.  Delivery took more time than expected but they got here for the gift we had to give. My biggest problem was the exhibit any price for just three pairs is socks. You won’t get another order from me until the price goes down.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T17:08:54Z,5,"I ordered 2 pairs of socks. They came quickly and were spot on representations of the pets I chose. In one of the pictures, one of the dog’s ears was slightly cut off. I left a note, asking if they can smooth out the ear for the final product. They did and the socks came out perfectly! Would recommend!"
PupSocks,2021-01-02T17:08:16Z,5,"Hi there,I ordered a pair of pup socks just 2 weeks before Christmas. To my syrprise they were delivered to me Christams Eve. I gave them to my Daughter the ""Dog Mom"" socks, She is 31, and absolutely loved them.Thanks Pup Socks,Regards,Marianne"
PupSocks,2021-01-02T17:06:32Z,3,Cute looking socks - the picture turned out cute but the socks are a weird shape and don’t fit my sons feet so he can’t wear them :(
PupSocks,2021-01-02T17:06:28Z,2,The mask I ordered was skimpy and not large enough to fit my son's an adult face.  The image I sent was cropped to a minimum and overlaid with cute fish bones rendering the cat's face almost unrecognizable. I was disappointed but we all enjoyed the idea of a masks with Evie the cat on it. 2 stars for the fun and laughter the masks provided. However the mask is not a usable item.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T17:05:56Z,1,I ordered on 12/4 and still haven’t received them.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T17:05:47Z,4,"The socks were super cute, but shipping was not updated and until they arrived so I had no idea if they even shipped until they were in my hands."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T17:05:19Z,2,"The color was great and the print was cute, but the socks weren't comfortable and had no heel built in. My husband didn't like them and it was a waste of $35"
PupSocks,2021-01-02T17:03:27Z,1,Still waiting for socks I ordered early in December for Christmas. It’s Jan 2. I received wrong pair and I can’t reach customer care
PupSocks,2021-01-02T16:59:33Z,1,"They sent me the wrong socks. Wrong color, wrong dog. I emailed them and got an automated message about how USPS is at fault. I am still missing an order that is probably because of mail delays (which is expected due to holidays, covid, and underfunding USPS). However, the wrong socks are not USPS fault. I have not received an email back at all. I would love someone to contact me please!"
PupSocks,2021-01-02T16:58:08Z,2,The socks have poor quality and the fit is poor as well. Not worth the price. Will not buy again.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T16:58:03Z,1,"I placed an order on December 3.  It was weeks before I received communication that my order was on hold and I had to contact pupsocks repeatedly to find out what the problem was.  I submitted a new photo, but never heard back as to whether it was acceptable or not.  They offered a 50% refund since my order would not be there in time for Christmas, and never heard back when I agreed to the late delivery.  I am still waiting for my order and still have not heard back from the company.  Such a disappointment."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T16:57:13Z,1,Having ordered a gift on the 5th December I still haven’t received it.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T16:56:37Z,5,"Super soft blanket, great representation of my pupper and kitty, and the gift recipient loved it! Also, having the larger size for taller nappers is key!"
PupSocks,2021-01-02T16:55:43Z,4,Still Haven't received my stuff that I ordered on December 12 2020
PupSocks,2021-01-02T16:55:42Z,5,I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of these socks! The service was excellent as well!
PupSocks,2021-01-02T16:54:17Z,5,"Absolutely perfect. Thiscwas a Christmas gift for my mom, and SHE LOVES IT!!!!"
PupSocks,2021-01-02T16:52:59Z,1,Complete scam! Paid and never got my order!
PupSocks,2021-01-02T16:52:34Z,1,"I placed my order 12/5/20, received 12/24/20 and it was the incorrect product! I've reached out through all customer support methods and have yet to hear from anyone for over a week!! Horrible service & this was a gift!"
PupSocks,2021-01-02T16:52:32Z,2,"Strange material for socks....not at all what I was expecting.  Maybe because they have to be able to print the image on a specific medium.  Communication when inquiring about shipping and production was slow.  It took over 20 days to get my socks...so make sure you have enough time to get your items.  I was pleased with the design, but not the material."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T16:52:24Z,1,"The worst customer service I’ve ever gotten with an online order.. socks didn’t arrive in the time line I was given, and they still haven’t! Tried contacting the company & employees, including the CEO, and haven’t heard back from anyone! I will never order from Pupsocks again and will continue to highly discourage anyone else from ordering! WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!"
PupSocks,2021-01-02T16:52:19Z,4,"Great prints, but the fit of the sock is strange. It makes for a wonderful gift and they were very appreciated!"
PupSocks,2021-01-02T16:52:16Z,1,"I ordered these socks on Dec 4 with an assurance that they would arrive before Christmas. In fact the website continued to claim orders would  be delivered before Christmas for a week after I ordered mine. I did not receive them before Christmas, and I had to purchase other gifts. Also, customer service is terrible! They do not respond at all or after weeks send a form letter response it does not apply to the email sent. I will never use them again."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T16:51:23Z,5,"The Perfect Gift for the Dog Lover in Your LifeMy wife was the recipient of the blanket, socks and mask. We had pictures of our current and past dogs. She said it was the perfect gift."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T16:49:59Z,1,"Worst shopping experience of the year. Absolutely awful. DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY.No reply, fake tracking info (shipper said it does not exist), never received order, ZERO contact from customer service. They have disappeared with my money and have not replied to 4 emails."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T16:49:26Z,5,My wife loves em. Also got pup ring. Good job
PupSocks,2021-01-02T16:47:12Z,1,Placed my order on Nov 21 for my wife‘s Christmas present. It’s now January and I don’t have them.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T16:44:53Z,1,I never received it.  Ordered in November.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T16:44:20Z,1,I still have not received them. Please contact me
PupSocks,2021-01-02T16:41:18Z,1,"Bad Customer ServiceOrdered socks on December 4, Sent multiple follow up emails but received no response. Yet they have the audacity to email more 'deals'. Not worth the time or money."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T16:40:36Z,4,"The mask is super cute. The uploaded photos look great, however the quality of the mask doesn’t seem that great. The ear loops seem cheap as well as the fabric. I gave it as a gift, late, so will see how it holds up over time."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T16:40:23Z,1,Order placed well before Christmas - still not here January 2nd.  Contacted customer service and did not here back from them in over two weeks.  Placed all the shipping blame on the Post Office.  Will never uses again.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T16:39:52Z,3,"please make a larger coverage mask -this will not cover nose, mouth and chin; not sure it is actually wearable!"
PupSocks,2021-01-02T16:38:19Z,5,Fast and efficient. Great communication!
PupSocks,2021-01-02T16:38:17Z,4,They look great-and seem like good quality socks-o ha bet washed them or worn them yet so can’t speak to their wearability
PupSocks,2021-01-02T16:37:48Z,5,The masks and blanket are made of quality material. They arrived on time and the recipients are enjoying them. I have ordered from you before with the same results. I am sure I will order on the future.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T16:37:05Z,5,"Hehe. So cute.  Got them for my daughter for Christmas.  Got both our dogs on them.  She wears them almost everyday now.  So, yes, they smell as bad as the dogs at this point..."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T16:36:45Z,1,"HORRIBLE customer service! I had ordered a pair of socks on December 4th for a Christmas gift.  When they arrived on December 15th, they weren't the right order (I ordered blue cat socks and received purple dog socks).  I immediately sent an email to customer service and then proceeded to email them every day but did not get a response until Saturday.  After I sent in the photo requested of the wrong order, I again did not receive a response from anyone for another five days.  They then said they were reshipping the order.  I needed these the next day for Christmas so I asked for a full refund and to cancel the order.  Again it took days before I got a response.  I was beyond disappointed as this was the only gift I had planned on for someone, and I was left scrambling to find something else at the very last minute."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T16:35:37Z,1,Ordered custom pink socks with dogs faces for wife.  Received green socks with a cat face.  Took 4 emails to finally get a reply.  Was sent another order that arrived after Christmas with wrong colored socks but dogs faces correct.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T16:35:17Z,1,Quality of the sock is not good.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T16:34:54Z,2,"The material is a smooth polyester rather than a weave, which now that I think about it, makes sense. How else will they get the images onto the material. I still don’t like the material. Also, I bought this for my 9 year old as a gift. The size chart says the XS will fit youth but that’s not the case. I wear a size women’s 6 (US sizing) shoe and the socks were large on me."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T16:32:03Z,4,"The socks were a big hit, having my 20 YO cat’s face immortalized was a perfect gift BUT the sock themselves, they didn’t fit right.  Toe area was floppy and rest if sock was more like tube sock even with heel defined in sock.  Hoping after washing they will fit/feel better on foot."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T16:31:27Z,1,The socks do not have a true sock shape. The material is not soft. More polyester feeling. I confirmed that I ordered the correct size for foot/shoe size and yet the heel part of the sock is way off. Not sure if I can return a personalized item but I will try. This company definitely charges a lot for poor quality. I ordered a similar product from a different company and for half the cost I got a better quality sock.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T16:30:56Z,5,This is my second order from pup socks and both orders were perfect!
PupSocks,2021-01-02T16:30:56Z,1,"Product quality was poor, sizing was very off and delivery slow although the latter was forgivable given COVID issues."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T16:29:55Z,1,"I'd like to give a review but can only state how disappointed I am. I haven't yet received the,  over $60.00, blanket i ordered for my wife with pictures of our three pets but instead I received a blanket with someone else's pet on it. Only to learn it's nearly impossible to contact you to fix the problem,  instead I get automated email replies. I've opened a claim with PayPal Protection to hopefully get my money back."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T16:29:18Z,5,A great gift! The recipient loved the socks!
PupSocks,2021-01-02T16:29:14Z,5,Great product !Long shipping but understandable because of the covid.Excellent customer care because of the delay.Entirely satisfied !
PupSocks,2021-01-02T16:29:13Z,1,I still do not have my order which was completed wrong in the first place. Will never order again!
PupSocks,2021-01-02T16:28:30Z,3,"Excellent print, the format is unusual with too much space for the toes, and no real heel. However, the fabric is very flexible and adapts well to any foot. Still, I would prefer a higher quality stick to make it usable for everyday."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T16:27:27Z,1,I never recieved my order
PupSocks,2021-01-02T16:27:00Z,1,They didn't follow my very clear request and made the socks incorrectly. I reached out a week ago and have still not heard back. Very disappointing to be stuck with overpriced socks that can now no longer be gifted.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T16:26:57Z,5,"Great gift, my husband loved them. They looked really big when we got them but the fit perfectly!"
PupSocks,2021-01-02T16:26:14Z,4,"I want to give these 5 stars! The picture of our dog on socks was perfect for a Christmas gift, however they are not stretchy at all and my fiancé couldn’t get them on. I ordered a men’s 10-13 as my fiancé wears a size 13 and they are too small. There’s no give in the fabric at all how socks normally are. I washed them and tried to stretch them but still nothing. The reaction of him opening it was awesome though."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T16:26:11Z,1,I received the wrong order. And I tried emailing a few times and I still have not received any responses.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T16:25:12Z,1,Order from 12/5/20 still has not arrived by 1/2/21
PupSocks,2021-01-02T16:25:11Z,3,Pictures turned out good. The material of the socks is different from what we expected.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T16:24:48Z,1,"I ordered a blanket from this company on Nov. 21 and I still haven't received it, despite numerous promises I would. First time I contacted them, they said it would ship that week & gave me a 15% refund. After that it was close to impossible to get in touch with customer serv. Sent numerous emails, that were never answered, their chat was no longer working, and when they finally responded, it was empty promises. They blame huge xmas rush, but I found later they have a history of this, many complaints, numerous with BBB, and people never receiving their order or a refund. If I could give less than 1 star I would. Sadly, I fear I will never see this blanket."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T16:22:45Z,1,"I still have not received my order or my refund. I originally received the package, that was empty! A customer service rep eventually got back to me and said that I would be receiving my order and 25% off. I still have not received my order, the 25% off or any full refund on my purchase. This was supposed to be a Christmas present. My next email will be to the BBB."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T16:22:34Z,5,Got this for my mom for Christmas. I ended up giving it to her for her birthday instead because I was de excited with how it turned out!  And it shipped out faster than I imagined it would. The blanket was so soft and the pictures were perfect!  I want to get one for myself and all my friends now!
PupSocks,2021-01-02T16:20:47Z,1,"I bought these socks for my daughter for Christmas.   They are not even wearable.  They scratched her legs inside.   She cannot wear them.   I sent a note to Pupsocks to address the issue and I never got a response.    Poor quality, even poorer customer service."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T16:20:47Z,4,Service was good and the product is good
PupSocks,2021-01-02T16:20:00Z,1,"The socks are cool. But I only received one of the two pairs that I ordered.  They were intended to be a gift for my sons after we lost two of our dogs, and I wasn’t able to get to them."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T16:18:49Z,1,"At this point my order never arrived. Was ordered over a month before Christmas and I still have no idea where it is.The shipping information shows it was last consigned from ASENDIA and post Canada tracking shows the item was never received.Needless to say I am extremely disappointed, and had to purchase another gift for my family’s gift exchange."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T16:15:52Z,1,No one will get back to me about my order’s eta. I ordered these over a month ago and now christmas has passed. I’m starting to think your website is a scam and I’m wasting my time. I understand there is a delay bc of Covid but you should be transparent with customers about this while they are placing their order.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T16:15:38Z,1,"It's been almost 2 months and I still haven't received the socks.  The company missed the holidays and their delivery deadline.  They are so busy they can't even respond to emails.  They bit off more than they can chew this holiday season and they earned this 1 star review.  They are blaming the post office but no other company was as delayed as this one, so I have my doubts, and they are the ones who chose the post office for their shipping needs anyhow.  They might have saved a couple of bucks on shipping vs. UPS but look at what happened."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T16:12:54Z,5,"The socks were so cute and the picture was so clear. I will say that if you have big feet (the receiver of the socks was a size 13), the picture will really stretch out and look distorted."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T16:12:36Z,5,The socks that I ordered were excellent! The images of my pets were cut out perfectly! Thanks!
PupSocks,2021-01-02T16:11:44Z,1,"To start, I placed my order on December 4th and the website said the order would arrive well in time for Christmas and last day for Christmas orders was much later. I place my order, pay my money and wait. And wait. And wait. About a week before Christmas I start to panic and send customer service an email asking about my order. Nothing received until days later and they say there was delays due to USPS but my order wasn’t even marked shipped until 12/14 then received by USPS 12/21. My order did NOT come in time for Christmas. It came 2 days after Christmas after the family member I bought it for was gone home. It came after I purchased an alternate item so I didn’t look like a jerk on Christmas. When I got the item I opened it and there were hardly any pictures on it of the dogs face it’s much different than the picture it shows online of multiple face shots. So all in all, I threw $80 in the garbage because I don’t want a blanket of someone else’s dog and I’m not holding on to it until next year when I’ll see them again. Waste of money, don’t buy! If I could leave 0 stars, I would"
PupSocks,2021-01-02T16:05:43Z,2,"I ordered a pair just after Thanksgiving to give as a Xmas gift. I figured that it would arrive in time. Our dog had a Christmas bulb collar in the picture that I made a note asking to be included with the face for these Christmas Sox. Was told by “chat feature” that the request, “wouldn’t be a problem”. Was bummed that my directions weren’t followed. No collar on the Sox. Couldn’t reach anyone. By the time I did hear back it was too late to correct for Christmas. They did apologize, and gave me a code to use for another pair. I do appreciate that. Bummed there was no number to call or “chat feature” as there was online in November."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T16:05:26Z,1,It’s been close to 30 days and I haven’t received my order. I get misleading USPS text messages daily saying my order is arriving late. If I want a more detailed update USPS make you pay extra.Bovine Scatolgy!!!
PupSocks,2021-01-02T16:02:54Z,2,"I was sent the wrong socks (completely wrong - wrong color, wrong dog).The socks were not a comfortable material - not soft at all.  Sorry. I got these as a gift for a friend and I was really disappointed."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T16:00:46Z,5,These socks were a huge hit as Christmas gifts! Fast shipping and great quality!
PupSocks,2021-01-02T16:00:36Z,2,Good concept but the socks were terribly uncomfortable! They do not stretch! No one in my family wants to put them on! Very disapointed!
PupSocks,2021-01-02T15:59:14Z,1,Never receive my order.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T15:56:57Z,5,Outstanding customer service. Fast and committed to customer satisfaction.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T15:54:28Z,5,"My son loved the socks of his new puppies. He literally howled and shrieked with joy and surprise! That’s hard to do with a teenager, so thank you!"
PupSocks,2021-01-02T15:53:15Z,5,Awesome socks. Thanks.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T15:52:53Z,2,"The idea is nice, but the material is unfortunately unwearable. It’s for a good cause and the socks are cute, but they will be forever left in the sock drawer."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T15:51:58Z,1,Ordered my socks November 20/2020 as a Christmas present. Socks still have not arrived as of January 2/2021
PupSocks,2021-01-02T15:50:42Z,1,Have not recieved my order. I want my money back.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T15:49:13Z,1,"I ordered an expensive blanket on Black Friday 2019. It’s now January 2, 2020 and my order hasn’t shipped. Ship or refund!"
PupSocks,2021-01-02T15:45:11Z,1,"I ordered my blanket on November 21st as a Christmas gift for my niece. It arrived on January 2nd which wasn’t the fault of pupsocks. But, when it arrived it was the wrong blanket entirely. I had ordered a white blanket with 2 dogs on it and I got a blue blanket with someone else’s dog all over it. Now to deal with customer service...."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T15:44:13Z,1,"I ordered a custom Christmas gift for my difficult brother-in-law at Thanksgiving. Now it’s January 2 and the gift is still not here. But I have had 4 reminders to review the product, and at least a dozen discount offers if I order more. Customer service is very slow and minimally engaged. I would have paid more for expedited shipping, but the initial estimate was the the gift would arrive by December 10."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T15:42:56Z,5,They came in a timely manner and were adorable. Not quite as fitted as I had hoped but good enough
PupSocks,2021-01-02T15:37:41Z,5,I had them put the faces of two of my girlfriends cats on socks and they came out great!  They cropped the head of each cat perfectly and the quality of the socks were good.  Very satisfied customer
PupSocks,2021-01-02T15:36:25Z,1,Horrible! Customer service is non-existent! I tried to order some socks for my brother and not only did I receive random CAT socks instead of my custom DOG socks but I emailed two different times trying to get my order resolved and I have still heard nothing! Extremely unprofessional and annoying. That was weeks ago! Never again! Get your custom socks somewhere else! So disappointed. Total waste of money.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T15:36:24Z,1,My order was not correct. I sent a picture of my dog but received socks with cats on them.  Sent email but have yet to receive a response. Hopefully after the holidays are over my order will be corrected or money refunded. I will update my review at that time. So disappointed.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T15:34:06Z,5,The quality of the image was really good
PupSocks,2021-01-02T15:30:05Z,2,"This is a cute idea and the socks look great. They are unwearable though. I couldn’t even get mine on my feet. Each sock is a tight , shapeless tube with no give. I got four for my family and it’s a fun little surprise upon opening, but it ends there"
PupSocks,2021-01-02T15:20:49Z,1,Unfortunately my package arrived with a large tear in it and no socks. I contacted customer service and received a generic email from the CEO saying it was a busy time of the year. So basically I wasted $30. Very disappointed.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T15:14:59Z,1,I did not receive my order!!!!
PupSocks,2021-01-02T15:12:02Z,1,"Still haven’t received product ordered from November. Terrible. Have reached out and no personal contact returned. Would like a refund at this point, but not able to get any follow up. May have to take it up with my credit card company at this point for the refund. Frustrating as it was supposed to be a Christmas present for my kids."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T15:05:59Z,3,The socks are beautiful because they have my dogs faces on them - the cropping is a little wonky- and the toe area is like a penguin flipper - so they are unwearable. I think the quality of the sock could be much better especially given the cost.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T15:05:14Z,3,I loved the pictures of the dogs and colors were great but the material leaves a bit to be desired. Not soft enough.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T15:00:58Z,5,Got the blanket and gave it to my college aged daughter for Xmas. She said it was her favorite gift. Loved it!
PupSocks,2021-01-02T14:58:31Z,5,Is it really cute. My son absolutely loved it as a Christmas gift this year.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T14:56:32Z,1,The socks look super fun but are the most uncomfortable socks ever. My boys won’t wear due to this so a complete waste of money.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T14:52:26Z,1,"purchased this a month ago during some holiday promotion (3+ weeks before christmas) and still haven't gotten it. I was told it would take 10 business days to get it. It took 2 weeks for them to have it even be shipped and the tracking number says it is still ""pre-shipment"" AKA the shipping company is waiting to receive the package. I understand holiday rush but I even reached out to customer service and they did not respond. i'm sure the products will be great but do not expect the fastest service or the best customer service"
PupSocks,2021-01-02T14:38:30Z,5,"Love the blanket!! It just took a really long time to get here. However, part of that was USPS."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T14:31:42Z,1,"I ordered blue socks with my daughter’s dog on it in late October. It was intended as a birthday gift for my son-in-law for December 6.  After many inquiries I received purple socks with a blurry dark cat on it. I have emailed numerous times and was assured I would receive the correct ones. I was even sent a picture and tracking number which daily shows they were never sent.  This company appeals to your emotions, takes your money then could care less if you receive your product."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T14:29:45Z,5,They looked amazing! Love to see the option of having grippers in the future.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T14:29:45Z,1,The quality  of these socks was really poor. The material was cheap and the shape of the socks just didn’t work. The idea is good but what’s the use if you can’t wear them? Huge disappointment.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T14:25:23Z,5,"The blankets we received were very cute, material was nice and thick, our kids love them!"
PupSocks,2021-01-02T14:24:04Z,1,I never received my socks. My order was returned to sender. I reached out to both my local post office and Pupsocks. Only my post office got back to me saying the package was empty and that was why it was sent back. I placed my order 12-4 it was returned to sender 12-22 I contacted Pupsocks the same day and as of 1-2-21no response from them.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T14:19:05Z,3,The picture was cute but the socks were not well fitting
PupSocks,2021-01-02T13:46:25Z,1,Placed this order December 8th. An order was received two days before Christmas and it wasn’t even my order. It’s now 1/2/2021 and still don’t have my order but they keep saying it’s been shipped. I feel for the person whose blanket I got because they also didn’t receive their order!!  Hoping the company figures this out and we both get the right blankets that we ordered!!
PupSocks,2021-01-02T13:41:56Z,1,"Your company is terrible. I love the line here to contact customer support! You cannot contact them. Order from another company that donates to animals, since they lie about everything else they probably lie about donating also. My guaranteed Christmas delivery came a week late. Your customer service consists of generic emails blaming the postal service. I’ll never order from you again!"
PupSocks,2021-01-02T13:31:26Z,1,"Received order 12.26. I did not get the correct pup on my socks. I emailed letting you know and I got a generic response on 12/27 stating it was being worked on. Still have not heard a word about my order, I sent another email this morning...not happy and so disappointed. This was supposed to be the gift that was going to be so special. I just want my money back so I can take my 30$ somewhere else to get what I asked for."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T13:22:22Z,5,I got my item quickly and as described. They did a great job of just getting the faces without losing too much detail. I got my girlfriend a mask with her cat on it and she absolutely loved it. Definitely recommend!
PupSocks,2021-01-02T13:14:16Z,5,Good quality socks. Great pictures included on the socks!  So cute!
PupSocks,2021-01-02T12:45:32Z,3,I wish I would have gotten a call or email and asked to lighten up the picture I sent as the socks came out a little darker than i would have liked but otherwise they were good
PupSocks,2021-01-02T12:44:25Z,1,"I placed my order on December 1st and still haven't received anything.I cannot comment on the product, but they are definitely not able to produce on time. Still today, January 2, the tracking only says ""Shipment Information Received"". Will I ever receive them? Excellent question."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T12:35:43Z,5,I bought the socks for my daughter of her dads dog and my cat for Christmas. She loved them
PupSocks,2021-01-02T11:28:01Z,2,"Initial correspondence started out less than stellar, but then the representative decided to make it right when called out. I feel that I was lied to about production time. Package just sat around for almost two weeks without being updated, and then suddenly appeared a couple of days after I had reached out again and asked for a credit. The picture that I was supposed to print out and give as a gift was totally unacceptable and I would have been highly embarrassed to do so. The blanket itself was a hit with the receiver, it was just a horrible process to go through to get there. I also don’t agree with the price charged for the quality of the blanket. I don’t know as I would order again."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T10:50:26Z,5,"Excellent merchandise quality, exactly as advertised. Production progress and shipping information was very good/helpful!"
PupSocks,2021-01-02T08:06:54Z,5,"We had our cat, Gary, put on a blanket and socks for a gift. They were perfect. When the items were delayed in transit, the designers sent cute images of the designs I could wrap and put under the tree. Thanks for going above and beyond when things were beyond your control."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T08:00:07Z,1,"Placed my order 2 months ago & still have not received it.  Worse yet, these were Christmas gifts & it is Jan 2nd & I have still not received my order"
PupSocks,2021-01-02T07:19:43Z,2,"The print quality of the socks is good but the actual sock material and shape is horrible. They don’t fit your foot properly as they’re a flat rectangular shape with a square toe, not foot shaped with a heel groove and tapered toe like normal socks so the print stretches where you actually see the socks and makes them uncomfortable. The material is also very shiny and strange (for socks), making them look cheap and also quite uncomfortable on your foot. Postage to Hong Kong also took longer than 1 month which was not ideal as I bought them mid November as a Christmas present which arrived in January."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T06:10:55Z,1,"Terrible customer service. I placed my order on 12/3 and received a confirmation email stating I would receive my order in 8-10 business days. I finally received my order post Christmas, it was intended to be a Christmas gift, 19 business days later. I would also say the quality of the items is poor. And I would have liked to have seen a proof prior to manufacturing, as the photo blanket is not how I would have expected it to turn out. Not impressed to say the least. Of note, I emailed customer service twice and sent two messages through PayPal with no response. I will not be purchasing from this company again."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T05:39:07Z,5,Super cute. The images of our cats was spot on. My daughter loved them. Great customer service too.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T05:32:21Z,1,"Orders socks on Dec 4th,  after 10 days and not getting any kind of shipping information, I emailed them for an update and the response I got was a  shipping label was created.  Since then there hasn't been any kind of update on shipping.  I emailed them on Dec 28th again and got the generic response of they are flooded with orders and doing the best the can to get orders delivered before xmas and blamed USPS for the shipping delays which is complete BS because I ordered from dozens of other companies that used USPS and got my package with little or no delays on shipping.  It is now Jan 1st and still nothing"
PupSocks,2021-01-02T05:29:29Z,1,Horrible experience......I was over charged in triplicate numbers from what was advertised.  Three of items ordered were completely wrong.  There was no one to call.  I sent an e-mail complaint and received an unsigned reply saying they were a small company and would try to respond later after the holidays.  We could not be more disappointed.No stars is what I would choose at this point.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T05:12:06Z,1,"The product was not printed as expected. The color in the photo was dull & faded, did not match the original. I sent in a request to get the socks reprinted & got an automatic response that they were busy but would respond within 72 hours. I waited a week & then reached out again. I still have heard nothing back at 2 and a half weeks past my original request. I don't need the gift anymore because it is now more than a week past Christmas. There has been no attempt to communicate or fix the issue. The material is different than expected for a sock and they also run large. Definitely overpriced for what you get. A cute idea but not worth it for a lack of communication and customer service."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T04:54:53Z,2,"These socks, while a cute novelty, are exactly that: a novelty. These do not seem to be made like actual garments. Each of the 4 pairs I purchased bunches on the top of the foot near the ankle bend, and the toe shape is very boxy so it appears sloppy when wearing. Because of these things, the socks are uncomfortable when wearing shoes. My family has decided that these should be confined to around-the-house wear if that. The picture print quality is good, but the quality of the fit is not."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T04:48:25Z,3,"The printing on the sock is great! However, I ordered the youth size socks & they are no where near a youth size. Much too big. I’m sure my size-1-kid-shoe son can eventually wear them. It just might be a few years. Additionally, there is no indication on the packaging that specifies the sock size, which makes me wonder if they are all one-size-fits-all?"
PupSocks,2021-01-02T04:41:59Z,1,Provided the incorrect product. Someone else’s blanket was sent to me and customer service has not followed up with me.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T04:40:39Z,3,"The quality of the print is meh. I wish I would have gotten a proof before I finalized the design. My pup has a dark face in the picture and a little photo editing would have helped see the contours of his smile better. Maybe I’ll do it again, but with better edited photos."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T04:35:45Z,1,"I ordered on Dev 4, well in advance of Christmas. It’s Jan 1, and still no sign of the two Christmas gifts I ordered. When I wrote to customer service to inquire on my order (on about Dec 19), I only got a reply stating shippers like USPS and UPS had delays. The problem is that my order still shows (today 1/1/21) “in production.” This is NOT a shipping issue. PupSocks happily took my $80 and have yet to produce my item. To add insult to injury, they wrote and asked that I share a review of their products. Also, they sent a generic email out saying that since there had been delays, they were offering 40% off of my next order. I’ll just say that since I will never order from them again, 40% of nothing doesn’t help much. They are scammers and I should get my stuff overnighted to me AND a full refund. I’m sure they won’t even bother to read or post this negative review, but if they do, hopefully some future customer might see it and know that there are MANY other companies out there who actually deliver their products and also tries to make it right if they screw up. RUN don’t walk to any other company before sending any $ to Pupsocks."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T04:28:04Z,2,"Still haven't received my order, despite the fact that my first order was re- processed. I did however receive a pair of socks from a a woman in Iowa, who thought the socks that she wrongfully received might be mine. They were not. I think you all have some work to do on your shipping situations"
PupSocks,2021-01-02T04:23:48Z,1,"I never received my shipment, yet I did receive this survey. I had to contact my credit card to dispute charge."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T04:20:11Z,5,Such a great gift! Good quality and love supporting businesses that help dogs in need.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T04:14:13Z,4,These are great gifts.  The recipients were both surprised and thrilled.  The quality of the pets’ face is high quality.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T04:11:44Z,5,I bought the socks as a gift for my sister. I got a  picture of her cat from her social media account so I could surprise her. I didn’t know if the quality would still be good but I’m happy to say it was! She looooved them! Very happy customer!
PupSocks,2021-01-02T04:06:34Z,5,These socks turned out SO cute! I am beyond pleased with my purchase. It took about 2 weeks which was a lot quicker than I expected given the personalization of the order. Very pleased!
PupSocks,2021-01-02T03:39:08Z,1,Socks were less then realistic and very uncomfortable.   Not something you could wear on a regular basis.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T03:36:52Z,1,"Was so looking forward to getting face masks with my two therapy dogs on them.Very disappointed to get very expensive masks that were not designed to be worn by an adult.  Masks might fit a 12 year old, but I did not order a child's mask.  Your ""one size"" product is not fit for use by a grown up person.Love your socks, but your masks are a total fail."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T03:31:27Z,3,Photo quality turned out good but the socks are super thin
PupSocks,2021-01-02T03:26:49Z,2,I’ve ordered my socks as a holiday gift back in November. It’s 2021 and I still don’t have them. No further explanation needed.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T03:23:01Z,2,The sox did not look like the photos I submitted.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T03:19:45Z,4,"I've placed 2 orders with PupSocks. The first, in November 2020, arrived on time and are beautiful, using the photos of my pets. A very unique gift, and so well liked that I decided or order a gift for another person and something for myself using different photos of our pets.  The 2nd order was delayed, I was told, due to Xmas and COVID and I haven't received it yet, so I can't rate it.  I am able to track the location, in my State at this point.   I have been offered a card to show the recipient what is coming. I am eager for the 2nd shipment, with an item immortalizing my dog when she was much younger."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T03:09:44Z,2,"The image is great, but the socks themselves are horrible. They are boxy, don’t fit, aren’t soft, and are a very weird material. Unless they magically transform in the wash, I’ll probably never wear them. Very disappointing."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T03:06:21Z,1,We were sent the wrong product and after contacting the company over a week ago we have heard nothing.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T02:52:49Z,5,The ordering process was easy.  Although holiday/COVID shipping was crazy PupSocks was very proactive with updates and providing a mock up of the item incase it did not arrive on time.  Thankfully it arrived just in time for Christmas.  The blanket was super soft and the photos were great.  It was the perfect gift and loved by the recipient.  Great quality item.  Great customer service.  I will definitely be using PupSocks again.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T02:41:21Z,5,Perfect! She loved it!
PupSocks,2021-01-02T02:34:33Z,1,It’s been over 3 weeks and I still have not received my socks which were supposed to be a Christmas gift.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T02:25:52Z,2,"Fit is unwearable.  The sock is cute but I ordered the size M for women's size 10 and the foot is so long that the toe sticks out or the heel is up to my ankle.  Even if the length was good, they are so tight at the ankle that they bunch up and feel very uncomfortable.  I am sad I will not be able to wear my kitty socks."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T02:23:50Z,1,"Placed an order December 4th, one month later and haven’t received it."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T02:21:44Z,1,Never received items!!!
PupSocks,2021-01-02T02:17:56Z,5,Bought the blanket/ throw with our dogs photo on it for my daughter who moved away for school. Brought tears to her eyes. One of the best gifts we've given her.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T02:17:50Z,3,"Was fine, ordered because it was a good cause more then anything , but it’s still hasn’t arrived almost a month later and they used usps witch for the price of the socks kinda sucks"
PupSocks,2021-01-02T02:13:39Z,4,Photos came out great...wish the socks were made of soft cotton but very fun gift!
PupSocks,2021-01-02T02:13:16Z,1,We placed our order a month ago and still haven’t received our order.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T02:08:41Z,1,Worst things I ever bought! They are not socks....they are the cheapest imitation of socks (not evens sock material) I have ever seen! Definitely wouldn’t recommend!
PupSocks,2021-01-02T02:03:59Z,5,I ordered a blanket for my daughter for Christmas. I was so happy that it arrived in time. She loved it. It is soft and high quality. I ordered  it with pictures of both our dog and cat. The pictures came out well on the blanket. I am going to order another one for my other daughter. This is a great product.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T01:57:51Z,1,Arrived after Christmas with the wrong dog's picture on the socks. Sent email to customer service and have not heard anything back.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T01:54:26Z,5,super cute socks n very soft blanket
PupSocks,2021-01-02T01:51:06Z,1,"Horrible experience with my Christmas order. Order placed November 30, it is now January 1. Website only states “in production“. I’ve tried numerous times to email, only to get generic responses of the same verbiage. My credit card was charged on November 30, luckily I went through PayPal and will be putting in a dispute because there is no one to talk to at this awful business. Customer Service is nil. No phone number available. Worst company to deal with ever."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T01:49:07Z,5,very cute gifts
PupSocks,2021-01-02T01:48:57Z,1,Still haven’t received anything.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T01:47:04Z,5,Great job!  Great communication and great customer service. I got the socks delivered in time for Christmas exactly as promised. Thank you!
PupSocks,2021-01-02T01:45:08Z,2,"Promised by Christmas, ordered on December 5th, no contact until I had to ask where my stuff was, and delivered on December 28th.  Made me look like a jerk at our family gift exchange, so will never order from again.  Great quality stuff, but business practices will prevent repeat orders."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T01:30:21Z,5,The images of the puppy I wanted on the mask was cropped perfectly and looks awesome on the mask I ordered. I’m very impressed with the resolution quality on the fabric.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T01:18:37Z,5,These socks came out better and cuter than I expected!  I loved them.  the picture came out just the way I wanted.  I will probably order more for birthdays in 2021
PupSocks,2021-01-02T01:16:43Z,1,These are not socks. They are  large scratchy tubes with a bad chemical smell.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T01:16:09Z,5,"These socks were perfect. I asked for the company to specifically cut around the pictures of my cats so you couldn't see background on the socks, and they did it exactly how I hoped! They feel like good quality material, and I'm very happy with my purchase. I would order again if I ever feel the need to have multiple pairs of socks with my cats picture on them. 😆😁"
PupSocks,2021-01-02T01:14:26Z,5,Awesome products.  the blankets are so soft.  These were a big hit as christmas gifts.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T01:09:46Z,5,Dope socks. Great crop job. Would definitely recommend.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T01:03:02Z,5,Absolutely Amazing. I’d give it more starts if I could. We ordered the blanket for our 13 year old daughter as a Christmas gift.  She’s absolutely loves it and shows it off to everyone. The quality is excellent and the pictures came out beautifully.  Worth every penny.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T01:01:20Z,5,Great product
PupSocks,2021-01-02T01:00:52Z,1,Placed 2 orders a month ago and only received one. I email them but no one responds
PupSocks,2021-01-02T00:57:18Z,3,"I ordered one pair of socks on December 4th, and they arrived just in time on December 23rd. The socks were made just as expected and are of high quality. My only frustration was when I inquired about the order and was told there was no record of my order. Fortunately, I had my email with confirmation, so that was resolved quickly. Just wish they had arrived sooner, but given the christmas rush, I can't complain too much. Overall, a good experience."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T00:56:32Z,2,Well I appreciate these uncertain times but I have been waiting for my order since Dec 4. I am in Canada and seems the socks are in Miami still. 8 did appreciate the email with the picture of the socks but for 35.00 it is now quite a lot of money for the inconvenience.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T00:45:49Z,1,"Do NOT order from this company. Their customer service does not respond for weeks, if ever. They tell you production of the socks takes 1 day but that isn’t even close to accurate. Just look at their Facebook page. Every post has people complaining that they get no response or never received their product. The company is a scam - don’t waste your money."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T00:45:31Z,1,"Placed an order as a gift for a friend. Was sent the wrong item with a picture of someone else’s dog. Have emailed a couple of times and still to this date, no response."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T00:44:32Z,1,"Picture that was sent in you guys cropped out 3/4 of it. It looks like garbage, completely unsatisfied with the final product. If I knew the picture I sent in was only going to be partially used I would have never wanted you to proceed. Terrible all around experience and am hoping to get money back from this crappy product."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T00:40:34Z,1,Ordered over a month ago and shows my order has been in preshipment for two weeks. When I email for an update all I get is a canned auto response email saying the are working on it. Very disappointed
PupSocks,2021-01-02T00:39:35Z,1,Terrible. Sent at least three emails and never even heard back from the company. I placed an order on 12/7 just for a single pair of socks. It is January 1st and I have still not received them!
PupSocks,2021-01-02T00:35:12Z,4,"Great picture, great likeness, decent delivery timing."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T00:23:39Z,1,I have not received my order.Very dissatisfied
PupSocks,2021-01-02T00:20:37Z,1,"Ordered at very beginning of December. Hoping for Chanukah, failed. Would settle for Christmas, failed. Still waiting...very disappointing."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T00:18:16Z,1,Ordered a pair of socks on 12/3 ! Got notification they were going to arrive late 12/26 then 12/27 etc . Still no socks ! I’m very disappointed and don’t think I will get my socks . There is no one to contact as I would rather a refund.  I will never order from this company again!
PupSocks,2021-01-02T00:16:39Z,4,The print is great!  The sock material is very thin and I don't think it will last long.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T00:14:10Z,2,The socks are super cute. The material is really strange. It doesn’t stretch like a normal sock and they have a strange shape. Great novelty gift. Poor gift for actual use.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T00:12:21Z,2,Ordered 1st of December blanket  as a Christmas gift and still have not received it. Very $$ .Shows it is still processing.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T00:12:06Z,1,Received my socks finally. The Pro:  -my cats face looks super duper cute on them!!!The Cons: -horrible quality- terrible fit (tube shape with no curve at the ankle so it bunches)- material is similar to that used for a team Jersey (subliminated nylon) Honestly the quality is so poor I cannot recommend this as anything but decoration or to be worn for very very short periods of time without shoes
PupSocks,2021-01-02T00:09:10Z,5,"These socks were a terrific Christmas present for my wife. Our dog, Rusty, was recreated faithfully. A great way to take your pet with you."
PupSocks,2021-01-02T00:07:44Z,1,I still haven't received my order.
PupSocks,2021-01-02T00:05:22Z,1,"I ordered socks well before Christmas.  A week before Christmas I received someone’s cat socks.  When I emailed customer service, which was the only way I could find to communicate, I got a “boxed” response saying you were working hard on my order and blaming the post office.  I was trying to let you know I received someone else’s order.  I have protested the charge with American Express, and they have refunded me, but my boyfriend is very disappointed that he will most likely never receive his socks with our white German Shepherd on them.  Never again.  And I was born and raised in Atlanta - I was thrilled to order from an Atlanta based business!  Good luck."
PupSocks,2021-01-01T23:57:21Z,1,"Very disappointed in these socks!! My daughters are both sizes 8.5 and 9.5 so, I had to order mediums. Which unfortunately, they are way too big considering your sizing is 9-11(which I think is odd).  They also are very wide at the toes so, when they wear shoes they get all bunched up. Also, there really isn’t a place for the heel and they just fit them very odd. I will not be ordering again and unfortunately, they will probably never wear the socks!!!"
PupSocks,2021-01-01T23:53:04Z,1,Hard to review when I still have not received the pair I actually ordered.
PupSocks,2021-01-01T23:43:34Z,5,"Nice quality socks. I have what I consider ""ok"" resolution photos so I was nervous how it would turn out but it looks great. I would recommend."
PupSocks,2021-01-01T23:36:00Z,4,"arrived way too late, but socks are cute"
PupSocks,2021-01-01T23:35:33Z,5,I LOVE the blanket I ordered for my son. It was the best gift under the tree. The blanket is warm and cozy with our beautiful “Izzie” smiling at us. Highly recommended!
PupSocks,2021-01-01T23:32:12Z,1,"The picture of my black dog was put on a black background therefore you can't see him at all.  Extremely disappointed. I bought the blanket and socks combo, wasted $80!  I would like you to remake it with a lighter background at your expense!  Please respond. Ginger Reynolds"
PupSocks,2021-01-01T23:26:31Z,1,I’m still waiting on my order placed on 12/13. I understand there is delivery issues currently due to the automated email I received when I inquired about this but it’s still very frustrating
PupSocks,2021-01-01T23:11:14Z,2,"I ordered two masks! The pattern and pic of my dog cams out really good! However, they were delivered after the intended time but they did send me an iou card to wrap which was nice. BUT, they were abnormally small and one of them came broken like the string was broken which I was really sad about :("
PupSocks,2021-01-01T23:06:41Z,3,"The quality of the print is amazing! But the cut of the socks (shape or however it’s called) is not comfortable, it doesn’t fit accurately and creates the front part of the ankle to feel all bunched up"
PupSocks,2021-01-01T23:06:31Z,1,The picture of my dog was great BUT the quality of the actual sock is HORRIBLE. I will never wear the socks bc of how uncomfortable they are and the use of cheap fabric. So disappointing.
PupSocks,2021-01-01T22:49:12Z,1,Fun novelty sock however the socks aren’t wearable because of the awkward fit and bunching in the front.
PupSocks,2021-01-01T22:47:46Z,5,So cute and so comfortable!
PupSocks,2021-01-01T22:46:00Z,1,ORDER NO. 2486898 Has never arrived
PupSocks,2021-01-01T22:35:50Z,5,The socks turned out great.
PupSocks,2021-01-01T22:32:46Z,5,"As advertised.  Color was as pictured. Picture of the dog was clear, not blurry."
PupSocks,2021-01-01T22:20:57Z,1,"Do not buy from this company. I ordered a pair of socks on Dec 4, 2020. A package arrived around December 21st with a pair of socks that I did not order. My order had a picture of a dog. The order that arrived had cats. I immediately wrote the company  and as of today, 1/1/21, I have still not received a response. I went on Facebook on Dec 28, 2020 and left a message on their main page and even sent a private message. Again, no response. The company continues to post new pictures on their Facebook page but will not respond to the numerous customers that appear to have the same issue I have had. What a incredibly frustrating and sad disappointment!Response- Yes, a full 30 days after I reached out with the problem I was given a full refund. What a nightmare this was to get this company to respond. No coupon code could ever bring me to go through that again! To anyone that may want to use the coupon code that they shared with everyone for the trouble that I went through, do yourself a favor and order from someone else."
PupSocks,2021-01-01T22:14:22Z,5,I got these for some friends with their dog onn them. They loved them! Good quality socks at an affordable price.
PupSocks,2021-01-01T21:54:43Z,1,Order never received. Placed 12/1/20. Contacted company only to receive generic email.
PupSocks,2021-01-01T21:51:45Z,5,The blanket turned out amazing and the blanket is super soft and big!
PupSocks,2021-01-01T21:39:54Z,5,Love this company!! You made it easy for me to give my niece pup socks with her favorite pup for Christmas. Thank you!!
PupSocks,2021-01-01T21:39:10Z,3,"The material was different than normal Cotten sock material.  That’s not bad, just a note.  The socks came out super cute.  I wish it didn’t print 1/2 or 1/3 of the way on a bone it looks a bit strange but overall the socks are cute.  The shipping was terrible.  I ordered them 3 weeks before Christmas and don’t receive them until the 31st of December.   I didn’t receive notice they would be later than Christmas until after the holiday.   If shipping wouldn’t have mattered I would have given them 4 or 5 stars."
PupSocks,2021-01-01T21:38:09Z,2,"My wife liked the idea and was happy her pups were on them, however I thought you guys would have done a better job trimming the faces my collies face was cut off. I didn’t receive the preview until 2days after the socks arrived, or else it could of been corrected then."
PupSocks,2021-01-01T21:36:38Z,2,"I was very disappointed in the fabric. Love the concept, but the fabric was really cheap where are you would not want to wear them."
PupSocks,2021-01-01T21:32:28Z,1,"I ordered socks over a month ago and still haven’t heard back from anyone about what’s going on, and the shipping update hasn’t moved in a month. Would not recommend"
PupSocks,2021-01-01T21:22:42Z,4,It took over three weeks to receive my order.  Other than that pretty satisfied.
PupSocks,2021-01-01T21:17:26Z,5,These socks were among my husband’s Christmas gifts and he LOVES them. He’s mad about our dog Trixie and her sweet face was perfection on the Pup Socks. He is delighted with them as am I.
PupSocks,2021-01-01T21:17:24Z,1,"All they do is send you a million emails and never send you your stuff, over a month of waiting and still nothing!"
PupSocks,2021-01-01T21:08:59Z,2,I have ordered in the past and been very satisfied with your products.  This year I ordered in early December and have still not received the products.  These were gifts and I am very disappointed.  I have not received any updates or notice of delay...very poor customer service.
PupSocks,2021-01-01T21:08:25Z,1,STILL waiting!!! Ordered the first of December for Christmas. Received the wrong order. Beyond disappointed.
PupSocks,2021-01-01T20:54:06Z,3,Other than shipping taking forever they sock print turned out pretty good. The main issue for the socks is the look like they should fit a duck. They are super wide and flat.  Their is no defined heel in the sock.  My wife said they are impossible to wear with shoes as they would just bunch up really bad.  That being said $30 + for a pair of socks is pretty steep.
PupSocks,2021-01-01T20:50:02Z,5,Socks were just as I expected and delivered in a timely fashion- even during the holiday rush
PupSocks,2021-01-01T20:35:47Z,1,Order quick and arrived in time but the product is terrible. If these are socks I am Santa. The hell of the sock is painted on not stitched it is basically a closed sleeve to  put your foot in. I reached out several times to speak to customer service and it has been crickets have not heard back from anyone.  There are better products out there that also donate $ to good causes.
PupSocks,2021-01-01T20:23:37Z,5,So happy with my purchase!! And my boyfriend loves them too! Been showing them to everyone!
PupSocks,2021-01-01T20:11:32Z,5,I gave these as gifts to my boyfriend and his brother and they were a huge smash! They love them. They came out so perfect. Thank you Pup Socks!
PupSocks,2021-01-01T20:02:05Z,2,These do not even resemble regular fitting socks.  I would gladly send back for a refund!  That’s a lot of money to end up with oversized and oddly shaped socks!
PupSocks,2021-01-01T19:58:29Z,1,"I’m sorry, I really love the idea of the personalized socks and mask...however, mine still haven’t arrived so I can’t speak to the quality.I did get the apology email with the mock up of the mask to show my daughter what she was supposed to get for Christmas. Great. The problem is that I ordered her socks and a mask...with TWO faces on them (her 2 cats)...and the mock up gift was of a mask with ONE cat. I didn’t even show her. Anyway, I love the idea and if her items ever arrive I am sure she will be thrilled. So far the experience has been underwhelming."
PupSocks,2021-01-01T19:55:31Z,1,"The concept is amazing. The execution- not so much. I ordered my items Dec 1 thinking it’s enough time to get to me before Christmas (they also said on their website that it’ll take 10 business days) it’s already past Christmas and I still haven’t received the items. Spent too much money for something that didn’t even get to me in time. Don’t waste your time and money with this company. When I tried to ask for my items, they only forwarded me to the USPS (oh, it also takes a whole week before the items left their facility even though the label was made already and that’s after 10 days when I placed the order) just a total disappointment for something too expensive. Still don’t have the items. Spent at least $150 from them and Nothing to show for Christmas."
PupSocks,2021-01-01T19:53:55Z,1,The graphics were dark and the socks were made without a heel cup or the stretch to accommodate one. They fit my size 9 feet poorly and they bunched up on the top of my foot in uncomfortable folds that dug in.
PupSocks,2021-01-01T19:47:55Z,1,"I can’t believe they ask for a review. I placed an order 12/4, my confirmation email said I’d receive my order in 8-10 days. My order wasn’t shipped until 12/21. When I complained they immediately started blaming the USPS. I still haven’t received it.I can not comment on the quality of the order as I have not seen the product yet.Well Pupsocks, “Be carefully what you ask for, cause you just might get it”"
PupSocks,2021-01-01T19:47:34Z,1,"I placed a large order of 4 blankets on Dec. 2 which did not arrive in time.  When I did receive an email with e-cards to share, there was only 3 and one of them was not what I ordered.  I've made several attempts to reach customer service with only getting back scripted, non-helpful responses.  I'm yet to receive my order.  This was the first order ever placed with PupSocks and was VERY disappointing, never mind that I have not even received the order yet was charged already.  I would appreciate a personalized response with offer of assistance."
PupSocks,2021-01-01T19:38:39Z,1,The photo is really cute but the sock quality is horrendous. I would never buy these again but love the idea and will look for other companies making better quality socks.
PupSocks,2021-01-01T19:34:56Z,2,"Ordered these as Christmas gifts for friends with plenty of time to receive before Christmas, so I could then mail them out. They arrived the day after Christmas, 22 days after I ordered them. They shouldn’t have claimed that you would get them in 8-10 days if they couldn’t actually do that. When I emailed to see why they hadn’t shipped, I didn’t receive a response until a long time later, after they had arrived. When shipping isn’t free, you should be guaranteed to get it when promised. Also, for the price paid, I would like to receive a mock-up before production, so you can see if it actually looks good. The product material is strange and not at all soft and they look huge for the size I ordered. That said, it’s fun to have the picture I wanted on some socks. Never ordering again though."
PupSocks,2021-01-01T19:24:20Z,5,"I bought a blanket as a Christmas gift using a pair of the funniest cat faces I was able to screenshot on someones social media. The blanket ended up looking cool, and she really likes it. The different sized faces, looking in different directions, cracks me up. Thank you...."
PupSocks,2021-01-01T19:12:33Z,5,The socks were great.  The mail was a bit slow but I was kept up to date in the progress.
PupSocks,2021-01-01T19:07:45Z,1,"The idea of Pupsocks is a great one, however I would never use this company again. There are many others out there for the same thing. This is based on my own experience, however I can see others’ had similar experiences.  They do not have a phone line to contact, customer service is an email that takes at least 5 days response - if any at all.  Live chat is non existent. I cannot speak on the product because it has been over a month and I still have gotten nothing from my $200+ order that I paid for. Based on how terrible I have found any communication, it actually does not matter if they are the “best pet socks/products” I have ever seen. The inconvenience and lack of any way to rectify this (and a 20% of coupon for my next order which would surely also be a fiasco) simply does not cut it. We are all living and working in a Covid world and that excuse is not something that is acceptable either. Very unhappy."
PupSocks,2021-01-01T19:00:21Z,5,It came out excellent just took a full month to get here but nonetheless it is perfect.
PupSocks,2021-01-01T18:55:46Z,3,Image on socks is excellent but fit is not. The fit of the sock is disappointing and does not fit well. Material not comfortable. Would not recommend these socks if you plan on wearing them.
PupSocks,2021-01-01T18:47:18Z,1,I have attempted to contact the company multiple times and have received nothing but an automatic reply message. I have not yet received my order and I received a message that it shipped 3 weeks ago.
PupSocks,2021-01-01T18:46:27Z,5,Have ordered from Pup Socks two times now and have been thrilled each time. Absolutely love seeing that package show up at my door!!!!
PupSocks,2021-01-01T18:41:45Z,4,Socks are fine no issues really but would appreciate and pay for something just a notch or two up in quality.
PupSocks,2021-01-01T18:37:49Z,5,Such a fun gift to give!
PupSocks,2021-01-01T18:35:10Z,1,I ordered these in early December and they have still not arrived. Every other Christmas gift arrived on time. This was clearly not a delivery issue but rather an issue with production delays and poor service.
PupSocks,2021-01-01T18:35:06Z,1,"It started out bad with unreliable tracking information. Didn't know it had arrived when my wife (whom the package was a surprise for) got it from the mailbox.The package is literally COVERED in pup socks branding with a message that says something like ""Your Socks Have Arrived.""Are you kidding me? Well that was a ruined surprise. The cropping of the cat's face was great, however these are the type of socks made without a sole. Meaning they don't conform to the foot and end up weirdly bunched up around the toe and/or ankle. Doubt she'll ever wear them. Extremely disappointed in the whole experience."
PupSocks,2021-01-01T18:28:15Z,5,"Socks and mask were well done.  They came out better than I expected to be honest.  I was impressed with the Customer Service.  Emails came regularly regarding the order progress and shipment.  They even sent a ""mockup"" email of my order in case it didn't arrive on time.  In spite of the USPS delays around the holidays my order arrived before Christmas."
PupSocks,2021-01-01T18:27:39Z,1,Still haven’t received them.
PupSocks,2021-01-01T18:25:45Z,1,Haven’t received item yet. It’s been one month. Will change review if I ever receive item.
PupSocks,2021-01-01T18:24:39Z,3,"The idea is fantastic, but the execution not so much. The quality of the socks are terrible. I don’t even know what the fabric is but I don’t expect them to last very long. They are not comfortable to wear. The mask is a bit better. It took forever to get them so I was even more disappointed."
PupSocks,2021-01-01T18:19:58Z,2,"Great design, awful customer service.Their customer service detracts from their great work.Don’t do it."
PupSocks,2021-01-01T18:19:50Z,5,"Ordered socks for our daughter putting her pup and husband on them. Decided to get a throw too! Love the throw! So cute! Socks look great, not the feel I expected."
PupSocks,2021-01-01T18:19:14Z,5,"My girlfriend LOVED the socks she got. I gave her a pair with her dog's face on them, and she was ECSTATIC about it! Great purchase."
PupSocks,2021-01-01T18:17:28Z,5,"Honestly, I wasn’t sure how this would work, but I ordered socks and blankets for my kids and they came out incredibly well.  The dogs’ faces were perfectly cropped and my order arrived early even in the Christmas rush."
PupSocks,2021-01-01T18:15:43Z,1,I ordered pupsocks on Dec 4 and have still not received my order. Disappointed.
PupSocks,2021-01-01T18:13:31Z,1,The quality was terrible!
PupSocks,2021-01-01T18:13:18Z,4,Just takes way too long to get them.
PupSocks,2021-01-01T18:10:41Z,2,"The socks, though expensive, make a cute gift. My order was processed quickly and promptly ""shipped"" in early December. Unfortunately, ""shipped"" only means a shipping label was created and the socks sat in some Petsocks warehouse for over a week. A message to customer service went unanswered. Ultimately, the socks arrived after Christmas. Very disappointing."
PupSocks,2021-01-01T18:08:09Z,1,Order was placed on 12/3.  Did not ship until 12/18.  Did not receive until 12/29. Extremely disappointed as I ordered in ample time for a pre Christmas delivery since your website says 8-10 days for domestic delivery.  I would like a refund.  I have emailed several times.
PupSocks,2021-01-01T18:06:37Z,5,The socks finally arrived and they are fantastic! I understand PupSocks could not control the delivery date abs very much appreciate you keeping me updated and what was happening with my order. Will definitely order from you again.
PupSocks,2021-01-01T18:06:00Z,1,I ordered a couple masks of my girlfriends dogs on December 4th.  I didn’t receive them until December 29th.  There’s no phone number to call and ask about your order so I emailed them.  This was after it had been 2+ weeks of no response that my order shipped.  It was suppose to be an Xmas gift but now it isn’t.   After I emailed them it took 10 days to get a generic response of sorry we are dedicated to satisfy our valued customers.  I guess that means I wasn’t a valued customer.  I emailed them back the same day they sent me one and I have still yet to receive a response.  The masks finally showed upon the 29th of December and they are nice but not worth the price or wait.  I would highly caution anyone who wants to order from this company.  I will never do buisness with them again since I must not be a valued customer and the service and turn around time are horrible.
PupSocks,2021-01-01T18:01:39Z,1,"If I could give zero stars I would! I did receive my socks but they had someone else's pet on them. Funny thing is I sent in a picture of a dog and socks showed up with a cat. I tried contacting the company numerous times by email and social media.....CRICKETS! Still to this day NO ONE has contacted me. Another funny thing is I keep receiving emails and offers on FB. Again, noone to address my issue. I understand mistakes happen but  with no effort to resolve the issue is unacceptable!"
PupSocks,2021-01-01T18:01:17Z,1,Never received my item.   Made multiple inquiries.  Never once received a response from them.  Currently have a fraud case pending.
PupSocks,2021-01-01T18:01:01Z,1,Product took almost a month. Uncomfortable & not worth the price.
PupSocks,2021-01-01T18:00:28Z,3,"Was a little disappointed about how the cat was cropped on the socks. He’s a main coon and has long fluffy hair, but when cropped they took all of his hair away and didn’t really look like him once cropped. The product is great! Just a little sad about the cropping of the photo."
PupSocks,2021-01-01T17:59:25Z,1,"I was really willing to write a good review. But I placed my order on December 4th I ordered  for it to be a Christmas gift. And today is January 1st of 2021 and I still don’t have my order!More than that, the carrier says that they only got pre-shipment information.Not good."
PupSocks,2021-01-01T17:53:13Z,4,Excellent looking product.Only issue slow delivery but due to Christmas rush
PupSocks,2021-01-01T17:52:03Z,5,Great! Exactly what I wanted.
PupSocks,2021-01-01T17:48:01Z,1,My order is taking forever to come and has still yet to arrived and it’s completely just inappropriate for the occasion it was meant for.
PupSocks,2021-01-01T17:46:35Z,1,The only small affordable meaningful present I could get my sister.  Still don’t have them.  Leaving your guarantee of Christmas arrival up when the post office was already overloaded and struggling was unethical and I don’t think that blaming everything On the post office is morally sound
PupSocks,2021-01-01T17:46:00Z,1,"All the pictures of your products told me the socks would be a wonderful Christmas present for my grandson with his support dog. As of today Jan 1st, I have not received my order. On Dec 1st I received confirmation that my order was received.  My order number is 2469245.  I am not happy as I missed give my grandson one of Christmas gifts and especially since it had his face and dog on the socks. NOT 😌 GOOD!"
PupSocks,2021-01-01T17:45:18Z,3,Over advertised and missed deadlines.  Product itself is fabulous.
PupSocks,2021-01-01T17:42:38Z,5,Amazing gift idea! Got Pupsocks with my girls face on them and my boyfriend loved them! The image quality was way better than I expected and the socks are soft and comfy. Will be coming back for a blanket soon!
PupSocks,2021-01-01T17:40:06Z,1,"3 weeks for delivery. Came on New Years Eve, not Christmas as expected. Email inquiry went unanswered. Fail for 2 pairs of socks."
PupSocks,2021-01-01T17:38:01Z,2,"I placed my order on Dec. 3.  The shipping label was created on Dec. 12, wasn't shipped until Dec 21.  My Christmas gift arrived Dec. 27.  Could not contact anyone from this company.  I received a boilerplate response each time which did not help at all."
PupSocks,2021-01-01T17:36:12Z,1,"The sock are very difficult to get on and wear.Also, the photo I submitted was severely cropped so that many features were left out.It was too expensive, for the poor quality product I received."
PupSocks,2021-01-01T17:35:15Z,2,What a great opportunity to get multiple orders but sorry the quality was so poor. The socks fit so strangely that they are not fit for human feet. In fact kind of gross. The mask is not a safe mask. Barely covers. Huge disappointment for a great idea.
PupSocks,2021-01-01T17:34:14Z,5,Although it took much longer to receive my order than expected (thanks to USPS!)... the blanket I ordered is ADORABLE!  It's so soft too!  Both of my pup's faces came out perfect and now my daughter can take her 4-legged friends back to college with her and not miss them so much!
PupSocks,2021-01-01T17:32:44Z,2,"A little dissapointed in the quality of the picture, very grainy and the color was very muted"
PupSocks,2021-01-01T17:32:36Z,3,"Socks with your pet’s face on them are always going to be a big hit, as these were. They’re a great gift and a nice surprise but in my opinion they are too expensive. They are not a great value for the amount of money spent to get them. I was expecting the socks to be the quality of Stance or Bombas but they are a strange polyester material and the texture takes away from the overall aesthetic of the product. I’d be much happier with the socks if I had paid half of what I paid to get them here."
PupSocks,2021-01-01T17:28:27Z,1,"Terrible company and productQuality of sock: Poor, plastic-like material, no heel, uncomfortableQuality of image/cropping: Poor, made long-haired coon cat look like short haired tabbyTimely delivery: Poor, took about a monthCustomer Service: Poor, more than a week for email responses, not helpfulOverall total junk. Feel like I got swindled by their misleading FB advertising."
PupSocks,2021-01-01T17:24:46Z,1,Horrible experience No customer service If you want to order pup socks you will never get them.
PupSocks,2021-01-01T17:22:11Z,1,Still waiting on my order.  It was placed almost a month ago before Christmas and I still haven’t received it by New Years Day.  Super disappointed because I bought a lot for Christmas presents.
PupSocks,2021-01-01T17:20:50Z,5,They came out great! Loved them!
PupSocks,2021-01-01T17:20:10Z,1,I ordered my blanket on December 4th and it’s now January 1st and I still don’t have it.
PupSocks,2021-01-01T17:17:06Z,5,"I was frustrated when I did not get a reply to my order request after several days, so sent a rather negative review. PupSocks did finally respond and sent me two new pair of socks in the size I needed. Want to say they did a great job of customer service and the socks are very cute. I will forward them to my granddaughter, who will be pleased."
PupSocks,2021-01-01T17:16:26Z,5,Excellent socks with perfect “picture” of daughter’s pup Luke. Thanks!
PupSocks,2021-01-01T17:15:20Z,3,"I ordered this item early 12/6 to get here by Christmas but it arrived on 1/31, also not super impressed with the quality or the way the item turned out."
PupSocks,2021-01-01T17:11:18Z,5,Masks came out great
PupSocks,2021-01-01T17:10:59Z,1,Mask was very poop quality and not wearable
PupSocks,2021-01-01T17:09:48Z,5,"We love our socks! I took a picture of my cat and dog, uploaded it and within a couple of weeks my socks arrived at my door. So easy and fun to surprise my loved ones with this gift."
PupSocks,2021-01-01T17:06:55Z,5,My daughter loved her blanket. I was worried she might not get it in time for Christmas but you guys came through and I had the blanket before Christmas so I was able to put the gift under the tree. I have another daughter that ordered a blanket to give us a gift and the lucky person who got the gift also loved their blanket. You guys are awesome!
PupSocks,2021-01-01T17:04:57Z,1,I ordered the socks on décembre 3 and I still didn’t get it. I wrote to them and they send me a automatic reply that they a lot of email ton answer... poor service don’t buy from them
PupSocks,2021-01-01T16:59:34Z,1,I ordered a pair of pupsocks for a Christmas gift. When I received my socks it was a totally different order. The customer service team failed to answer my emails and refund me.
PupSocks,2021-01-01T16:59:11Z,5,The socks were awesome! Delivery was well communicated.
PupSocks,2021-01-01T16:57:43Z,1,Totally wrong order was delivered to me. Didn’t even have a picture of my cat on it. It had a dog. Tried contacting you guys about it several times and no one responded to me. Not even easy to send the socks back. Would love my 30 dollars back
PupSocks,2021-01-01T16:57:24Z,5,Was very happy with product and the excellent customer service I received.
PupSocks,2021-01-01T16:54:19Z,1,Cannot review my 3 orders other than to say I have not received them. I placed them in early December thinking i would have them well before Christmas and am disappointed that I still don’t have them.
PupSocks,2021-01-01T16:54:00Z,5,These socks are exactly what I wanted for my so . The picture is clear and the exact likeness to our buster
PupSocks,2021-01-01T16:52:40Z,1,"My order was both incomplete and inaccurate. Although I did get a blanket that was as ordered, I got 2 of them, which I did not order and NONE of the 9 pairs of socks. I have received no response to my emails and there is no number to call to get a hold of anyone. Would NOT recommend this company to anyone."
PupSocks,2021-01-01T16:52:20Z,3,"Socks look fine, but are still in the box so I cannot speak to the quality. My biggest complaint is with the shipping speed. It took over a week from when PopSocks said the item waa ""shipped"" to when the USPS said they received the item. I ordered many items online this year and did not have that issue with other vendors. I ordered the item on 12/4 and it didn't arrive until 12/24. By that time I had already left my house and was unable to gift the socks. Also, the box I paid extra for was not that nice and came crushed."
PupSocks,2021-01-01T16:50:32Z,5,My husband loves his socks! The ordering process was so easy and they shipped quickly. They arrived with plenty of time for Christmas. We are very happy with our purchase!
PupSocks,2021-01-01T16:50:01Z,5,Got a pair for my wife and she loved them!!! They turned out awesome
PupSocks,2021-01-01T16:48:48Z,1,Made the order and it was stated that there was plenty of time for Christmas delivery.  I realize that we are in unprecedented times however we were in these same times when promised arrival times were posted.Customer satisfaction should be assured.  In other words what will you do for me.
PupSocks,2021-01-01T16:46:18Z,3,I ordered this as a Christmas gift for a friend on 12/4 the did not arrive until 12/28 which was too late. While the shipping time really took away from the gift the socks were really cute. They did a good job at just taking the head of the pup from the picture and not the background or body. They socks seem relatively thick but look a little large like they aren't quite the shape of your foot.
PupSocks,2021-01-01T16:44:12Z,5,Gave socks to my son-in-law for Christmas and they were a big hit. The reproduction of the dog’s face was perfect. Definitely recommend.
PupSocks,2021-01-01T16:43:17Z,1,"Took over three weeks to arrive, low quality. Customer service apologized, a week after I emailed them, but that was it, no refund, nothing. I would not buy from them again."
PupSocks,2021-01-01T16:41:43Z,1,My order was placed on December 4th and my product still hasn’t arrived nor is my usps tracking number updating with current information.
PupSocks,2021-01-01T16:39:33Z,1,My order shipped on the 21st of December and it has yet to arrive. I suggest tracking the packages before emailing your customers and asking them to review your products
PupSocks,2021-01-01T16:39:05Z,2,I was so very disappointed when my socks arrived. My order was double delayed due to late processing and slow mail. I was anticipating this family gift with very high hopes and when the socks arrived the material and texture and sizing was terrible. The socks seem cheap and uncomfortable.  Maybe this material is required to get accurate photos of which I had no problem but these were not the cozy wearable socks I had hoped for. Before I received my first order I was so enthusiastic I ordered another set of socks for my sister and her family for her 60th.  This was a wonderful idea but execution was not as hoped.
PupSocks,2021-01-01T16:38:42Z,3,"I ordered 2 ""dog design"" fleece throw blankets from PupSocks as Christmas gifts. The blankets are cute, very soft, and the printing turned out great. The blankets are thin considering the price; you are paying premium only for the novelty.While I'm happy with the finished products, the turnaround time was unacceptable. I placed my order on November 27, 2020, with written assurance on my order confirmation that I'd receive the blankets within 8-10 business days. In fact, PupSocks continued to send me marketing e-mails claiming that all orders placed by December 11, 2020 would be received before Christmas.  I did not receive the blankets until December 31st. So much for Christmas gifts! I feel fortunate the blankets arrived at all. . .the packaging envelope had been taped up by the USPS with a hand-written notation that the USPS took in the package UNSEALED from PupSocks. So weird.In summary, the PupSocks blankets are very cute and soft, and my order was accurate. I would consider ordering again from PupSocks; however, I would order several months ahead of my deadline, disregard PupSocks's delivery time promises, and expect long delays."
PupSocks,2021-01-01T16:38:13Z,5,I got a face mask for my girlfriend that has a new dog. She died and loves it.
PupSocks,2021-01-01T16:38:03Z,1,Placed my order on Dec 4 2020 for a Christmas present for my wife. As of Jan 1 2021 still haven't received the order.  Should have shipped within a few days of ordering according to the website.  Got notice that the order didn't ship until Dec 21! Obviously no way I'll get it by Christmas.  I contacted them by email and was sent an automated response blaming the post office for delays. It's not the post offices fault it took 17 days to ship! Then on top of all this they sent me an advertisement email on the Dec 18 saying it's the last day to order to have your socks by 2021! Very disappointed.  I would have not ordered had I known it wouldn't make it by Christmas.
PupSocks,2021-01-01T16:35:39Z,5,"I bought my niece socks with her cat, Garfield on them for Christmas. She loved them. I am very happy with the quality of the product and the price. Next year, my whole family will be receiving socks with my face on them. Thank you PupSocks!"
PupSocks,2021-01-01T16:30:57Z,3,I wanted the picture of the dog to be lighter on the blanket. The picture of the dog was a little dark and difficult to see his features. Although the blanket is very soft which is nice.
PupSocks,2021-01-01T16:30:22Z,5,I ordered 2 custom blankets for my kids and they were absolutely amazing!! Probably their favorite gifts 🎁
PupSocks,2021-01-01T16:25:29Z,3,Quality is good however sizing is not accurate. I ordered 1 size bigger than needed but still too small even before washing.
PupSocks,2021-01-01T16:24:01Z,1,Shipping very slow!   Still have not received them!
PupSocks,2021-01-01T16:23:31Z,1,Placed my order on 12/3 and still haven’t received on 1/1.
PupSocks,2021-01-01T16:22:00Z,1,I never received my package. It had been shipped and out for delivery for over a month now. I’ve send numerous emails to customer service and never received a response. Terrible customer service.
PupSocks,2021-01-01T16:21:39Z,1,Cannot review my purchase from 12/04 as I have not yet received it.
PupSocks,2021-01-01T16:20:14Z,5,Great product and quick shipping!
PupSocks,2021-01-01T16:17:27Z,1,"Still waiting on my order from the beginning of December! Haven’t received anything about the order, I had to go into the website to find out. Never ordering from her again."
PupSocks,2021-01-01T16:17:14Z,4,I ordered on 12/3 for a Christmas gift and still have not received. Very disappointing. **Update**The company replaced this missing order.  I received it late January.  I have updated my experience rating as I commend companies that fix mistakes and try to make it right.  Thank you.
PupSocks,2021-01-01T16:14:40Z,1,"I ordered Dec 4, as of Jan 1 I still have not received my product. It was a Christmas present that I was not able to give.  Very disappointing."
PupSocks,2021-01-01T16:14:26Z,1,Ordered 12/5 still haven’t received 1/1/21
PupSocks,2021-01-01T16:10:11Z,1,Never received my item. It’s been a month since I ordered and customer service doesn’t respond.
PupSocks,2021-01-01T16:10:03Z,2,"Although the picture came out really cute, the socks are a weird uncomfortable material that I have never felt. Definitely a highly overpriced gag gift."
PupSocks,2021-01-01T16:02:26Z,3,The quality is not what I expected for the price. It took over three weeks for delivery.The telephone number listed on the website went to someone wanting to offer a Walmart gift card and they hung up on me.
PupSocks,2021-01-01T15:49:56Z,1,"Hello,I received the my package just to find its not my order. I ordered my puppy's face and I got mans face on the socks.Its taking two days since i emailed customer service and i still didnt hear back.Monika"
PupSocks,2021-01-01T15:42:25Z,5,"Love these socks!I had ordered a pair from a different company and was soooo disappointed.  So I tried Pupsocks. My expectations were not high, so when they did arrive I was so excited! Great job, great quality and will order again 👍!"
PupSocks,2021-01-01T15:38:14Z,1,I ordered this Christmas gift on the 1st December and still have not received it!
PupSocks,2021-01-01T15:35:54Z,5,My sister loved her socks!! Definitely a fun and inexpensive gift for anyone who has a dog or cat. Easy order process.
PupSocks,2021-01-01T14:57:17Z,1,1)The blanket had our dogs face on it. You can barely see my dig. 2) The socks we ordered with my son in laws face didn’t turn out.
PupSocks,2021-01-01T14:53:31Z,3,Very strange material design nice but unable to wear doesn't breathe!
PupSocks,2021-01-01T14:06:19Z,1,Slow on delivery and when I emailed them the answer I got was I don’t know where your order is. The picture was cropped so much it may as well been a stock photo. Not what I expected for $30
PupSocks,2021-01-01T13:52:01Z,5,These socks are adorable and a great gift for any pet lover!
PupSocks,2021-01-01T13:00:17Z,5,"Great feeling socks, graphics are good"
PupSocks,2021-01-01T12:37:31Z,3,"The socks themselves were great.  One pair was the incorrect color.  The photos that were sent were nice, but came out a bit blurry on the socks.  Would not order again."
PupSocks,2021-01-01T12:36:16Z,1,The picture cropping was good but how they press the image on the sock ruined it. The stretchy part of the sock was flat and no longer stretchy. Unusable socks
PupSocks,2021-01-01T12:24:41Z,1,They are asking me for a review for a product that I ordered for a Christmas gift that I still have not received and it is now New Years Day.  Not very impressed so far.  I can't speak to the quality as of yet as I do not have the product.
PupSocks,2021-01-01T10:19:05Z,1,"Margo the Dog was cut up to the point of not even recognizing her, the material was very funky and it’s the worst thing I spent my $29.00 plus on . Very unsatisfied 😳"
PupSocks,2021-01-01T08:06:09Z,5,My sister LOVED the blanket & socks we got for her.  It was was a hard year for all of us & it was great to to see the genuine joy on her face when she opened the box.
PupSocks,2021-01-01T07:50:21Z,1,Never received product...its been almost 1 full month. No one responds to emails
PupSocks,2021-01-01T07:35:50Z,5,Cool soxes ! Thanks a lot!
PupSocks,2021-01-01T06:41:28Z,5,The blanket came out great. The dogs looked perfect. My niece loved her Christmas present.
PupSocks,2021-01-01T05:34:54Z,1,Ordered some socks and 1 month later they still have not shipped. They sent me a picture of what the socks should look like instead.. Would not recommend
PupSocks,2021-01-01T05:23:35Z,2,"2 stars because there’s nothing wrong with the socks I ordered, I was just greatly disappointed that they didn’t arrive before Christmas. I understand that there are delays due to COVID, and as a custom order, it takes longer, but with this in mind I ordered the socks over a month in advance so I would get these by Christmas."
PupSocks,2021-01-01T05:16:42Z,1,It’s been 3 weeks since I received a tracking number and it hasn’t been updated since. I have no idea where my purchase is.UPDATE: the reply says it’s been replaced and delivered..... but nothing has been delivered to me.
PupSocks,2021-01-01T04:54:43Z,2,"Print is good, but quality and socks shape is weird... very expensive for not much :("
PupSocks,2021-01-01T04:40:44Z,1,"I’ve never received my face mask order, I have sent multiple emails, I can’t find a phone number, and I only get responses telling me how orders are delayed due to shipping issues, I received my blankets but no face mask so I don’t think shipping is the issue. I just want what I paid for or a refund!"
PupSocks,2021-01-01T04:34:45Z,1,I ordered my product on Dec 3rd and have not received them yet. Please follow up with the USPS as my order has been sitting at the same facility for three days now.
PupSocks,2021-01-01T04:06:34Z,5,"The face was so real!! Looks just like our pup, love the socks!"
PupSocks,2021-01-01T04:03:14Z,1,Terrible! Ordered Dec 3 and received Dec 31 with a RUINED PAIR of socks. White crease across the socks. No communication from company. Tried getting ahold of them for weeks.
PupSocks,2021-01-01T03:58:21Z,1,Ordered as a Christmas present on 1 Dec 20.  Was told they would be sent before Christmas....it is 31 Dec and I still haven't received anything.
PupSocks,2021-01-01T03:53:36Z,2,Nice product but turn around time from order was unacceptable. Ordered them on Cyber Monday and didn’t arrive until Christmas Eve.
PupSocks,2021-01-01T03:50:23Z,1,"This company is irresponsible, untrustworthy, and IF you are lucky enough to actually receive what you order the product itself is terrible quality. This is the worst waste of money I did all year. Run. Run far and fast and didn’t look back."
PupSocks,2021-01-01T03:38:48Z,1,I ordered on December 3rd-Christmas gift. It is now December31 and my order has still not arrived.
PupSocks,2021-01-01T03:25:05Z,1,horrible customer service  Never received a response. I  have not received my order i put in 6 weeks ago and from the mock up they look bad.
PupSocks,2021-01-01T03:24:50Z,5,Good quality -- very happy with the socks!
PupSocks,2021-01-01T03:15:30Z,5,"I ordered socks, masks, and a blanket. They are of great quality and look fantastic! Would definitely purchase again!"
PupSocks,2021-01-01T03:08:56Z,1,"Ordered for Christmas present. I received an email that my order had shipped. That was two weeks ago, it still hasn’t shipped. Very disappointing and misleading. This is the first bad review I have ever left on a company, but this was just wrong !"
PupSocks,2021-01-01T03:04:58Z,2,Still haven’t gotten my order from a month ago. So much for Christmas presents. Wasn’t until I contacted pay pal with a complaint that it miraculously shipped  but still haven’t gotten it. Says it’s in route . Y’all need a much better system to satisfy your orders and if you don’t have one you need to not continue to take orders you can’t fill.
PupSocks,2021-01-01T02:03:00Z,5,These turned out so cute!!  I will order these again for many more presents!!
PupSocks,2021-01-01T01:45:07Z,1,I have not received my order. I have not had an update through USPS since they were in Miami on December 24th.Once I receive my order I will be happy to update my review.
PupSocks,2021-01-01T01:41:41Z,2,"I had ordered my blanket around November 26 or 27 for Christmas. Unfortunately, it did not arrive in time. A big part of this was USPS but it also was in production for quite some time so that was disappointing. In the ordering process it asks you to give specifications for how to cut the image you provide. They did not follow my specifications I requested which was also frustrating. When it arrived it had a large white line down the middle like the material was folded when they printed it. I reached out about 5 days ago to talk about how they plan to fix these issues. Their estimated wait time was a few hours but again, it’s been 5 days. I will adjust my review once I do hear back from the team based on the level of customer service they provide. I know the Christmas ordering of 2020 was overwhelming for many companies I’m just upset I received a product not done to my request and with a large flaw."
PupSocks,2021-01-01T01:34:18Z,1,"Sure I will love them once I receive them!  Ordered Dec 3rd, supposedly in time for Christmas but they never arrived. So much for my fun stocking stuffers!  Nobody likes Christmas socks in January. You guys either are a fraud or got in way over your heads. Time will tell. The same story is all over your internet reviews. A real business would be giving customers some sort of remediation for botching everyone’s Christmas."
PupSocks,2021-01-01T01:31:41Z,2,I still have not received my order or is now 15 days since it shipped and the mock up I received in the mail does not follow the specifications I left for the designer to include my dogs bandana. I would understand if they couldn’t do this but to message me ahead of time or prior to printing would have been better customer service
PupSocks,2021-01-01T01:28:13Z,5,"Ordered socks, a mask & blanket.  It was an easy procedure if you have photos of the pets on your computer.  The order came in time for Xmas and the recipients thought they were the best xmas gifts ever.  Additionally, besides the blanket having their two adorable dogs showcased the material was soft and cuddly and the printing was of great quality."
PupSocks,2021-01-01T01:26:45Z,2,Cute but not worth the price. Save your money. $60 for two pairs of socks.
PupSocks,2021-01-01T01:25:23Z,1,"Received the wrong order twice. Been trying to email support for over 2 weeks, no response. Company is still churning out ""order now to receive items before Xmas emails"" Unbelievably bad experience."
PupSocks,2021-01-01T01:13:31Z,1,I didn’t get my socks and you have the nerve to ask for a review. You don’t have a number to even call about this. I have literally gotten every order I have made for Christmas from all over the country and the socks haven’t even left Georgia.  Inexcusable and a flat out ripoff. You took my money.   If you guys were as good about endless emails and charging my credit card as you are about getting the order out quickly I’d give a higher review.  You didn’t even try to send a second pair just to see if the first order was lost.
PupSocks,2021-01-01T00:35:22Z,5,Such a fun Christmas gift! The socks look great and the recipient tells me they are very comfortable too. I'm already planning another order!
PupSocks,2021-01-01T00:32:00Z,5,Everyone loved all their gifts. Quality of the blanket was great
PupSocks,2021-01-01T00:27:13Z,5,"I ordered 3 blankets, 2 pairs of socks and a masks for family members. Each were personalized with their pets faces.. The quality is outstanding.  The pictures of the pets were perfect. The best thing was it was a great surprise for all to open. It made everyone smile and laugh. I enjoyed giving this gift. Plan on giving more as gifts in the future."
PupSocks,2021-01-01T00:19:29Z,2,"I ordered a pair of socks and they were shipped.  The post office ""damaged"" them (although the damaged package was empty.  I understand that is not your fault, but I have not had anyone from your company return my emails."
PupSocks,2021-01-01T00:14:37Z,5,So cute! Exactly as described!! Arrived on time for Christmas so I was very happy!
PupSocks,2021-01-01T00:09:42Z,5,My kids love their sock! Great quality and so much fun for them.
PupSocks,2020-12-31T23:58:30Z,3,"So I received my order today. Ordered Dec. 3 received Jan. 4. The socks are ok. The image of the dogs on the socks, don't look that good. The socks have a dimpled texture. That makes the images look spotty or grainy. I wouldn't buy them again. I changed my rating from 1 star to 3.I ordered two pairs of socks and have yet to receive them. It's been four weeks since I ordered them. It took two weeks before they were shipped. If I ever get them, I will update this review."
PupSocks,2020-12-31T23:52:06Z,1,"The socks were great. Unfortunately, they did not arrive before Christmas which you and your tracking said they would."
PupSocks,2020-12-31T23:50:38Z,5,Great product that provided many laughs. Thank you!
PupSocks,2020-12-31T23:44:33Z,1,"Terrible experience. Ordered for Christmas and not only did not receive on time, even though I sent several emails to customer service, I didn’t get an update until after the holidays. Poor customer service. Very disappointed.Update 2/10/21-still never received the product. Will never order from them again."
PupSocks,2020-12-31T23:44:27Z,1,Terrible customer service! I got an email that my order shipped but tracking shows it never left the shop. I was offered a picture to give as a Christmas gift. I ordered over 30 days ago and email the company four times with no response! Terrible!
PupSocks,2020-12-31T23:43:49Z,4,"Aside from taking a longtime to receive,they did arrive on Christmas Eve."
PupSocks,2020-12-31T23:36:58Z,5,These turned out perfect and arrived on time!
PupSocks,2020-12-31T23:36:11Z,2,"Actually, pay attention: this review was asked before I got the items... but here lies the essence of my impression...I ordered while expecting my items 15 business days later. I was expecting this order for a gift.While it was close to the deadline, my order was still in production.I wrote to ask if I could still expect my order on date... it took a few days. First I received the email with the tracking number, then, a few days later, the answer from my email.I know there are delays with the Covid thing, but still, I guess it should be clearly said on the website... I’m not the kind who complains a lot, but almost a month later, still no order and this stupid survey... hence my stupid review......but, still!"
PupSocks,2020-12-31T23:34:09Z,1,Socks were way too big!!! waste of money
PupSocks,2020-12-31T23:32:16Z,1,I haven't received the product yet. Ordered it over a month ago and was hoping it would come in time for Christmas and now am asked to write a review for it but I don't have a confirmation of when it will arrive or any shipping information :( hopefully it will come soon.
PupSocks,2020-12-31T23:31:11Z,1,"I can’t honestly give a worse review. Not only was my order completely incorrect (not my dog, wrong color and wrong size), the multiple messages I sent went completely unanswered. I haven’t received any response to my repeated emails and therefore I have not been offered a refund or a correction to the order. This was a (failed) Christmas gift which I ordered with plenty of time should there be an error.I hope this review motivates the company to correct this mistake and also warn others against ordering from Pupsocks."
PupSocks,2020-12-31T23:27:58Z,5,The socks & blanket were a huge hit with our girls.
PupSocks,2020-12-31T23:26:48Z,1,My order took way longer than what was said and when it arrived it was incorrect. Very disappointed. It was a Christmas gift.
PupSocks,2020-12-31T23:20:41Z,1,"It was not what I sent in to be done on the blanket. The blanket looks horrible and it cost me 85 dollars for such a cheap looking product. Would NOT recommend. So disappointed in the final product. I sent a picture, and the picture was not what was on the blanket. Just the head of a black dog....that you can barely make out as a dog. Horrible."
PupSocks,2020-12-31T23:18:57Z,2,"The print quality and photo-editing turned out really well, all the cat photos look great on the socks and they are super fun.But, as socks, I'm not sure what sort of tree trunk legs they were modeled after.  I bought ladies size S (size 4-8) for a size 6 foot.  Not only are they huge, but their shape seems to follow the anatomy of a foot with no ankle joint.  In addition to their lack of bend, there's little to no taper - too tight up top and like a large fabric bag around the foot.  I wasn't expecting a high performance athletic sock or anything, but they're basically unwearable.  Could work as thumb-less mittens?A cute gimmick at best."
PupSocks,2020-12-31T23:18:19Z,1,"Ordered on Dec 3rd. Still waiting.  Website says order was completed on Dec 22nd.  When I click on tracking number from USPS that you sent to me, it says my package has been awaiting shipment since Dec 23rd. Terrible service and no customer support phone number. Terrible experience.  Very disappointed."
PupSocks,2020-12-31T23:17:18Z,1,I ordered two face masks on December 3 for a Christmas gift.I have not yet received them and have not heard from the team with a definitive answer as to where my order is. Would be nice to get an answer and resolution.
PupSocks,2020-12-31T23:17:16Z,3,I was sent the wrong socks and it took a month to get them. Socks were cute but my dog was not on them😐
PupSocks,2020-12-31T23:14:32Z,5,These socks turned out SO amazing and made my daughter so happy!! The most amazing thing was that they sent a customized digital card so I could give it to my daughter in time for Christmas in case the sock gift arrived late because of the pandemic delaying deliveries! My vet daughter is proudly wearing her pup socks to work every day! Thanks for the awesome product!! :-)
PupSocks,2020-12-31T23:14:16Z,1,Never received
PupSocks,2020-12-31T23:11:10Z,5,This was the perfect stocking stuffer! Family loved it
PupSocks,2020-12-31T23:09:52Z,1,"Ordered this item in November.....got the wrong item was supposed to be a Christmas present for my daughter who’s pup had recently passed.still have not got the right item nor have I heard from anyone at all and were almost at January now. Absolutely no customer service can’t reach anyone have sent emails, messages through both Facebook and Instagram as well as the better business bureau...still nothing. I would not buy these again especially at the price of close to $40, I would not recommend to anyone."
PupSocks,2020-12-31T23:07:28Z,1,"The socks were faded, the picture smeared and I sent an email to customer service with no response. They are junk"
PupSocks,2020-12-31T23:03:18Z,3,Blanket was cute except I ordered a cat blanket and it came with dog bones!  I sent a chat asking to make sure that it had fish bones...no response.  I sent one again and was told it was already “in processing” and the order couldn’t be modified.  It was “in processing” for 2-1/2 weeks!!  You would think someone would put two and two together that it was ordered with a cat picture and should have fish bones...you would think.  Nope.  Cat blanket with dog bones.  Merry Christmas.
PupSocks,2020-12-31T23:00:06Z,1,Never received product. Ordered Dec 10th and still nothing.Not sure why I got a review questionnaire for product I never received.Probably never order again.
PupSocks,2020-12-31T22:58:01Z,4,"The quality of the socks and blanket were good both in the material used and the quality of the color and graphics. Unfortunately, the graphics were not correct. It was to be a photo of my son and his dog together. The blanket cane with just the dog in it and the socks had a photo of just my son...which was really weird. Took a bit long to get here too."
PupSocks,2020-12-31T22:55:38Z,3,I ordered this in plenty of time for Christmas for my daughter but didn’t make it. When we did receive it the blanket was very soft and the socks were cute. She loved them! The only complaint was I did ask for the one photo to be lighter so it matches the other. Kind of looks like 2 cats. It would have been nice if they contacted me if there was a problem or they disregarded the note.
PupSocks,2020-12-31T22:49:08Z,1,Terrible/no customer service. I received a pair of socks with someone else’s dog and almost two weeks later I have had no response from the company via email and no number to call. Complete scam of a company stealing people’s money. Awful awful awful.
PupSocks,2020-12-31T22:47:27Z,1,"I placed my order in early December, was stuck in y’all’s system for 10 days, and nothing was done about it until I called. A USPS label was created on the 15th of December and it was not delivered, or picked up by USPS until the 22nd. It is now somewhere in the USPS system (or so I believe, unless it’s still in “production” as my account says. This was the only gift I could give my family this year for Christmas and unfortunately they did not receive it on time. Every time someone contacts me it’s very generic and there is not a lot of customer service reaction. It’s not like I want a discount,or coupon, it’s just unbelievable that there was a 10 day timeline advertised and that is not the case; that is false advertising. I will be writing a complaint with the BBB (even though you guys are not registered and your ratings are a whopping 1.5/5). I will NEVER be purchasing from you again and I have already started talking about my experience with people that I know and social media. I don’t want to be a Karen but I believe I have been respectful and understanding through the process, it’s just unbelievable that you as a company have not done ANYTHING to keep my business or keep me from commenting on your business. I expect a response and I will more than likely contact my bank and start a fraudulent claim against you so I could get my money back. This has been the worst customer service. Best,Guillermo Aviles"
PupSocks,2020-12-31T22:43:16Z,5,Love this product!
PupSocks,2020-12-31T22:42:13Z,1,"Ordered on 12-04.  Email confirmation said I would receive the product in 8-12 business days.  As of 12-31, their website shows my order as ""in process.""  Inquired as to status a couple times on the website, but never received a response."
PupSocks,2020-12-31T22:40:35Z,1,I ordered green womens’ socks with a picture of our kitten for my wife. I got gray men’s socks with a Labrador  on them. I have had three emails to their return department come back as not going through. Can not find a number to call them. Horrible
PupSocks,2020-12-31T22:38:00Z,5,"The set up was simple and the delivery, even during troubled postal delivery issues, was on time for Christmas.  I got three pairs of socks with all three of my pups faces.  I also got the large throw.  The throw is soft and great quality as are the socks.  Their photos are perfect and very realistic.  I recommend these for all animal lovers!"
PupSocks,2020-12-31T22:37:00Z,3,Wonderful product however ordered it a month before Christmas and it arrived after Christmas. Very disappointing
PupSocks,2020-12-31T22:36:49Z,1,We paid por items and they never arrived. Already 30 days and items still showing “out for delivery “.
PupSocks,2020-12-31T22:36:16Z,5,"Gave two pair  of them to my daughter for Christmas, she literally cried. Won Christmas, thank you !!"
PupSocks,2020-12-31T22:34:03Z,1,I still have not received my blanket it was supposed to be a Christmas gift
PupSocks,2020-12-31T22:33:45Z,2,"I purchased two pairs of socks for my boyfriend for Christmas with our pets' faces on them and overall, am very disappointed in our experience, especially by the quality of the sock itself.I purchased from PupSocks because they were recommended to us by friends and they donate to shelter pets, so I was really excited to get our final result. This season they had huge shipping delays and despite ordering on 12/3, they did not come in time for Christmas. Even that though would have been okay as the company was super communicative about the delays and even sent mock-ups of the socks prior to the day. The mock-ups made me even more excited to get them!We received the package probably around 12/27ish and I will say, the design is awesome. I was so concerned that the photos I used were too blurry but these socks are seriously so spot on to our pets, I LOVE that. But that just makes the poor quality of the sock so much more disappointing because we can literally never wear these.Getting to the two stars part: the quality of these socks are unbelievable. I mean, they don't even look like socks; they don't have a heel. It's like an arm sleeve with a toe cap? And the fabric is....I'm not even sure. It is uncomfortable to touch but worst of all, there is no give and despite being ordered in a size L neither my boyfriend (size 12M feet) or I (size 7W feet) could get them on our feet and up our calves comfortably. I am ultimately so disappointed. I want to LOVE these socks because the design is perfect, but ultimately I paid almost $65 for something that will literally be thrown out."
PupSocks,2020-12-31T22:33:41Z,1,Ordered 12/3; not received as of 12/31. Money back needed!
PupSocks,2020-12-31T22:32:35Z,5,"Loved the end result and more importantly, my girlfriend adores the new socks. Shipping took longer than expected but with the current state of affairs it's hard to blame anyone."
PupSocks,2020-12-31T22:27:08Z,5,The pictures of our dogs were very clear and my kids loved them!
PupSocks,2020-12-31T22:26:59Z,2,"I ordered on Dec. 3, and I am still waiting to receive my order.  I have seen a mockup of what was supposedly shipped, but there have been no shipping updates since Dec. 13.  I'm leaving it at two stars for now in hopes that my order will eventually arrive, because the mockups look great.  However, it's beyond frustrating that the company's response is to blame it on USPS when it just doesn't look like the order ever left the building."
PupSocks,2020-12-31T22:26:38Z,4,"The socks were fantastic. If this was just about the socks themselves, this would be a 5 star review without question. I was frustrated by the time it took, with the socks being ordered on Dec. 2 and finally getting to my friend 4 days after Christmas. This was surprising and frustrating because my wife ordered 4 other pairs of the socks, and they all arrived quickly. I'm hoping my order was an aberration."
PupSocks,2020-12-31T22:25:20Z,1,We received the wrong color and dog on the socks and have yet to hear from anyone about making it right.
PupSocks,2020-12-31T22:24:27Z,1,We ordered the socks on Nov 27th for Christmas gifts for our children but didn't receive them until today on Dec 31st.  The delay was not the US postal service or Covid.  The socks were not produced until the week of Christmas and only because we sent emails asking why they stayed in a manufacturing status for 4 weeks.  Very disappointing with the servicewhen we ordered them so many weeks in advance for these special gifts for Christmas.
PupSocks,2020-12-31T22:23:20Z,2,"Print quality on these socks were great, the images were perfect cropped and clear. I ordered these on December 2nd, they were shipped on the 17th, and I received them on December 30th. I understand this is due to the pandemic and would have been acceptable had they blown my wife’s socks off. Quite to the contrary, it seems as though the makers have never worn a pair of comfortable socks before. She tried these on once and we’ve determined she’ll never wear them again. It appears the designers placed having a superior print quality above comfort. The sock on top of the foot bunches up and is essentially not wearable. If I were to put these in a frame they would serve their purpose, but that wasn’t my plan when purchasing them. I would not recommend anyone spend money on these socks if they’re looking to actually wear them."
PupSocks,2020-12-31T22:20:00Z,1,"Terrible. I bought two pairs of socks for 60 dollars and I never received them. When I reached out by email twice, I never heard back."
PupSocks,2020-12-31T22:19:22Z,3,"I thought the socks were cute, however, not what I expected.  I sent a photo and that was not what ended up on the socks."
PupSocks,2020-12-31T22:16:06Z,1,I am yet to receive the socks that I bought for my daughter for Christmas! Very disappointed.
PupSocks,2020-12-31T22:15:21Z,4,They look great!. The socks didn’t feel like cotton socks that I’m used though.still was a great gift for my mother though.
PupSocks,2020-12-31T22:12:16Z,1,Terrible customer service
PupSocks,2020-12-31T22:10:42Z,1,I made an order 12/3/20 expecting it to arrive before Christmas because the website states to order before 12/12/20 to receive before Christmas. Today is 12/31/20 and I still have yet to receive my order.
PupSocks,2020-12-31T22:09:21Z,2,It was kind of weird material for socks and the size was a little to large even though i selected the correct shoe size. Also for how expensive they were the cropping job could have been 10x better. I had a dog and 3 cats. the dog was done well but the cats faces were cropped super weird. I guess if your cats have long fur around their face they don't really include it even though I put a note in the comments for them to do it. So their faces just turned out super weird
PupSocks,2020-12-31T22:08:46Z,5,These turned out perfect! The socks are very high quality and the photo was perfect! I will for sure be ordering from here again!
PupSocks,2020-12-31T22:03:28Z,5,I bought a face mask with our pet cat as a custom design. PupSocks did a great job extracting our cat's face from the photo I sent in and the item was delivered in good time.
PupSocks,2020-12-31T22:01:01Z,1,I placed my order on December 3. It is now December 31 and I still have not received it. I will never order from this company again and would not recommend them to anyone else.
PupSocks,2020-12-31T21:59:58Z,1,"Possible scam website. No response from Customer service with a lost order. Just take a look at their Facebook page, it's full of comments that the company is not responding to. When you send an email to customer support, you get a template-reply from their CEO ""crying"" about how much money they have made and how they cannot handle the load as he's too busy reaping the profits while blaming others like the postal service. Take your money and business elsewhere there are plenty of competitors."
PupSocks,2020-12-31T21:59:48Z,1,"Never received product, emailed support twice without response. Will never recommend company or products. Still trying to receive product or refund. Very disappointed."
PupSocks,2020-12-31T21:58:00Z,5,"I love the socks so much!! A perfect unique gift for someone who already has everything. :) The fabric seems high-quality, and I'm impressed by the level of detail in the print! Overall, a great purchase."
PupSocks,2020-12-31T21:54:29Z,2,Fabric is poor quality and sock shape is weird. Did a good job with graphic.
PupSocks,2020-12-31T21:54:26Z,5,"I ordered theses for my parents for Christmas. The product quality is great. The feedback from the recipients are that the socks are comfortable and fit well. The quality of the photo is very good. Order was placed late Nov. 2020 and through no fault of this company, USPS was slow at delivering but Pup Socks sent mock-ups so that if you were affected by these delays you could show people for Christmas what the end product would look like. I thought that was very courteous and professional, and they went above and beyond what I would have expected them to do.  Overall, great product and the company handled difficult external situations very well. I would recommend this company to family and friends."
PupSocks,2020-12-31T21:50:54Z,1,Do Not order from here! Tried contacting twice and still get only a generic response. December 31st and says items are still in production but they want to blame my lack of receipt of gifts on USPS! I am SO disappointed that I don’t have these gifts! I plan on filing a claim with the bank to get the money back.
PupSocks,2020-12-31T21:50:34Z,1,This company is nothing but a scam. Do not buy from them and check out BBB ratings/reviews before purchasing from them. I ordered a purple blanket with my three cats' faces on it and I was sent a blue blanket with dogs on it. I have tried to contact the company about not getting the right order and I am unable to reach them. I read numerous complaints on BBB about this company regarding the same issues as well as some customers not even getting their order. I wish I had seen these poor reviews prior to my purchase.
PupSocks,2020-12-31T21:50:18Z,5,Masks came out perfect. Very cute and the photo looked great.
PupSocks,2020-12-31T21:50:09Z,2,Ordered socks on Dec. 3rd. And it’s Dec. 31st now and still have not received them. Emailed a few times and did not receive any correspondence. Def will not be purchasing from Pupsocks in the future. There are a bunch of different companies that do the same and that have better customer service.
PupSocks,2020-12-31T21:48:21Z,5,So so cute! My daughter loved the mask with our cats face.
PupSocks,2020-12-31T21:43:40Z,1,Hi I’m still waiting for a reply in regards to my my order here is what my dog face looks like in the blanket vs the picture I send please redo the blanket with him looking white like he is I’m also sending another picture just in case If you need another picture please use one of this 2 let me know what you guys are going to do. This is getting ridiculous that you have not reply to any of my email. Please reply and let me know an update on this.Anabella
PupSocks,2020-12-31T21:42:05Z,2,"The material is very unusual for socks (not very comfortable) and unfortunately they’re WAY too tight around my wife’s upper foot/ankle area. She’s a size 9 and I ordered socks that should’ve fit a women’s size 9-11. And no, she doesn’t have cankles! :’)"
PupSocks,2020-12-31T21:40:05Z,1,Haven't received the item in over a month and it missed the Christmas delivery.
PupSocks,2020-12-31T21:34:19Z,5,10/10 these are so cute! The photo came out very clear and no issues with ordering.
PupSocks,2020-12-31T21:33:16Z,1,"I ordered these socks almost a month ago. When they finally came in the mail, it was not what I ordered. I uploaded a picture of my cat and received the socks with another cat on it. Completely disappointed. I will NEVER order from them again. I would NEVER recommend doing business with this company!! If I could give less than one star I would!"
PupSocks,2020-12-31T21:30:26Z,5,Gave them as gifts and both recipients immediately recognized their precious pups.
PupSocks,2020-12-31T21:29:20Z,1,The bag came empty with nothing inside!
PupSocks,2020-12-31T21:28:54Z,1,"Placed my ordered December 2, it’s now December 31 and my package is no where to be found. Tracking number has it sitting in the same place for the past week without movement."
PupSocks,2020-12-31T21:22:37Z,1,Worst quality of socks. Dogs head was stretched didn’t read directions on photo to use. And sent a complaint Email to you all and you never replied. Don’t waste your money.
PupSocks,2020-12-31T21:15:49Z,1,"Very disappointed with the quality of this product! They do not fit like socks should – there is too much fabric on the top of the foot so they bunch up and are overall very uncomfortable.Very cheap fabric – not worth the $35 that we paid for them (that was with a $10 discount).The sizing runs very big, so there's a ton of extra fabric in the foot.Production/Shipping time was very delayed. I ordered on Dec 5th and was told to expect to receive them within 8-10 days (plenty of time before Christmas), but did not receive them until Dec 31.We also received a second package with someone else's socks (not our dog's faces). I've read several other reviews commenting about receiving the wrong order.Overall, very disappointed and would not purchase again!"
PupSocks,2020-12-31T21:09:34Z,1,"You suck! I still haven't received the order I placed on December 2. I had to give my daughter the paper mockup you provided on Christmas Day, but I'm astonished that you haven't made my order a priority. I placed two orders on December 2, one for my wife and one for my daugther. My wife's order arrived by December 14, but my daughter's order still hasn't arrived. Clearly this wasn't an error or delay with the postal service. You guys messed up and failed to send my Order #2471607.I expect you to remake the order, send it our priority mail and also provide me with a full refund for my trouble. Your company has been the greatest frustration and dissappointment of this holiday season! If I don't hear from you soon, I'll put Pupsocks on blast on Facebook and Instagram."
PupSocks,2020-12-31T20:58:40Z,1,"I ordered at the end of November under the premise of an ad that said orders printed in two days. December 7 I contacted the company via chat to ask the status of my order. The gentleman said he’d make sure it was shipped in 3-5 days. December 14, still hadn’t heard. I was told it will be shipped out soon. December 14 a shipping label was created but package never scanned until December 17. It is now December 31 and still have not received my packages. Waste of money would tell anyone do not use this company. I have not heard from anyone. Christmas Eve I did get an email that I could send to someone with a mock order to show I ordered something for them but who knows when I will get my order. I ordered in November thinking there would be plenty of time to have my order (blanket and a mask) by Christmas."
PupSocks,2020-12-31T20:57:32Z,1,"I ordered 12 pair of socks on November 19th as Christmas presents....over $200 worth.  I just received them today.  They use USPS a for delivery which is just ridiculous.  They tell you when you inquire about shipping that it will be there in time for Christmas and then once they finally ship it they say it’s out of their hands.  Terrible, terrible service.....will NEVER EVER a order anything from them again.  Totally ruined the special Christmas surprise I had planned for my family."
PupSocks,2020-12-31T20:53:33Z,2,"It took me over a month to receive my 2 orders, which were Christmas gifts. I ordered them just before black Friday, thinking I would definitely get the orders on time. The company even said that they were prioritizing all orders that were ordered before December 11, which mine were ordered way before that. Because they didn't come in time for Christmas, when I saw my family, they had nothing to open from me. I had to spend a good deal of money to mail everyone's gifts out after they came. The worst part about this whole experience was that I sent multiple message to customer support and only received one response that didn't help me in any way or give me any answers. There are tons of other companies like this one, so I recommend ordering from someone else. This ordeal really screwed up my Christmas."
PupSocks,2020-12-31T20:48:53Z,3,"I ordered 2 prs of socks and a fleece blanket. They were two separate orders. Each order took an exceedingly long time to arrive. The socks were fine. They don’t look comfortable or soft, but the printing was clear and they swerved the purpose I wanted. The blanket, which just arrived today, is a cheap fleece and sheds everywhere. The picture is not as clear as I had hoped or as clear as the pictures on the socks. The blanket was approximately $70, which made me hesitate to purchase it from the beginning. For that price, i definitely expected a higher quality item. I will recommend Pupsocks for the novelty of the products, but if you’re looking for any type of quality, keep looking."
PupSocks,2020-12-31T20:45:17Z,1,"Ordered one of their blankets as a Christmas gift at the beginning of December it arrived 9 business days after it was ""promised"", 5 days after Christmas. It gets worse, the blanket I received had three dogs on it, not one of them was mine! So i ordered in a reasonable amount of time, which they say would get to me no later than the 21st. They sent me a ""mock-up"" to give as the gift until the real blanket arrived, which was my dog. They don't even mail out the package until after Christmas. To top it all off they don't send the right blanket, not even close.  We will have to see of the rectify all the bad service..."
PupSocks,2020-12-31T20:24:44Z,1,"Pupsocks is garbage. They take forever to ship, don't answer emails, and will spam you relentlessly to buy more, even if your original order never comes. The quality is trash, too. It looks like someone printed these on the socks with their crappy home printer. After you wear them two times, the faces will be stretched out making your pets look demented."
PupSocks,2020-12-31T20:20:30Z,5,Socks were super cute and the gift recipients loved getting an unusual memorable gift they can really used.
PupSocks,2020-12-31T20:12:38Z,3,"I have ordered socks before and was very happy with the product. I ordered two pairs of socks on Nov. 27 and am still waiting for them on Dec. 31. If purchasing from Canada, order way in advance to ensure that you receive them your desired time."
PupSocks,2020-12-31T20:09:46Z,4,Still waiting on order. Ordered 30 days ago haven’t received as of yet.
PupSocks,2020-12-31T20:04:30Z,3,"Got them after Christmas, ordered on the Dec 3, got on 26th.  Socks are a weird fit, too straight so they bunch up and are tight at ankle and across foot."
PupSocks,2020-12-31T20:01:48Z,1,If I could give no stars I definitely would! I was sent the wrong socks as in not my dog! I sent 3 emails with no response until I was going through the channels with Paypal for return of money. PupSocks said they would correct their error and send the socks... 2 weeks later I'm still waiting! Will never order from them again!
PupSocks,2020-12-31T20:00:26Z,1,I placed my order in 12/3 and have not received the item or a tracking number. Customer service does not provide any specifics in when my item will be shipped. Ugh.
PupSocks,2020-12-31T19:49:42Z,5,Ordered for my wife for Christmas. First pair was wrong and not what was ordered. I know it was a busy time but reply and apology was timely. Received correct pair today and wife was very satisfied. Thank you
PupSocks,2020-12-31T19:40:12Z,1,"I spent a lot for my pups ok gifts - placed two orders and one arrived a week before Xmas and the other arrived after Xmas. For the cost I paid I expected the quality to be so much better. I was so excited about these because it is a very cool idea, but I am very disappointed. Won’t order again"
PupSocks,2020-12-31T19:35:19Z,1,"I received the wrong item in my order, and tried to contact customer service multiple times for a replacement or refund. I haven't heard back from them at all, and there's no guarantee that I'll receive my order or my money back."
PupSocks,2020-12-31T19:25:49Z,1,I ordered them in November only thing that wasn’t received before Christmas. being the very first gift I ordered I guess I expected a month to be adequate amount of time. Seems a little pointless to hold onto them If I receive them. They gave a gesture of here is a print out of your socks which I’m hoping is a mistake as it appears they ignored the only request I made.
PupSocks,2020-12-31T19:20:25Z,4,"I came across PupSocks via a Facebook ad, and I'm so glad I did! I bought my husband a pair of the cat-themed socks. The website was easy to navigate, they had multiple color and pet themed options, and uploading a picture was simple. My husband loved the socks! My only issue with the purchase was the amount of time it took to deliver, which with COVID plus the amount of online orders and slower mail was completely understandable. When I reached out to the PupSocks team about my order status, they were quick to respond and were helpful and kind! I would highly recommend PupSocks to anyone looking for fun socks featuring their furry companions."
PupSocks,2020-12-31T19:17:42Z,2,"I ordered on December 5th and didn't receive my socks until December 31. I understand the USPS is having delays, however the socks weren't shipped until December 20th. Fifteen days is a rather long turnaround time when you are promising delivery by Christmas (which they were on December 5th). The socks have the correct picture and it is printed on the socks correctly, but the material of the socks is very weird. I would not wear this and I am kind of embarrassed to give them as gifts now. Very troubling considering it was almost $60 for two pairs of socks. Will not be purchasing from this company again."
PupSocks,2020-12-31T19:12:08Z,2,"I still have not received my order yet. I ordered it first week of December and expected the order to arrive before Christmas, especially when your webpage indicated ""Lightening Fast Shipping"". When I finally received confirmation that the blanket was produced and shipped Dec 12th, I clicked on the tracking link everyday for over a week and it indicated there was no info. I finally received and email from your customer service group that there must of been an error or the package was lost. I asked for a replacement, and I still do not have an answer."
PupSocks,2020-12-31T19:06:29Z,1,"I ordered the product a month ago. I still don’t have it, I’ve sent three emails with no communications back, and today I received a survey asking how they did and what I put in a good review?  Use your imagination.  No product.  No refund.  No communications."
PupSocks,2020-12-31T18:48:08Z,5,"Great product, bought as a gift, arrived on time. And the quality is top notch"
PupSocks,2020-12-31T18:37:40Z,5,My son loved his socks! Everyone commented on them at Christmas. Thanks!
PupSocks,2020-12-31T18:34:11Z,5,These were the perfect gift for my wife and neighbor who watches our dog
PupSocks,2020-12-31T18:27:36Z,5,Great Fun Socks
PupSocks,2020-12-31T18:26:49Z,1,No communication.  Then when the crap arrived bag was open and the socks were not in there. Horrible!!!!!!!! Then no response when I tried to call
PupSocks,2020-12-31T18:11:39Z,1,"I got someone else’s socks in the mail and they were a Christmas present but nobody got back with me..So,I have someone else’s socks and they have mine"
PupSocks,2020-12-31T18:08:45Z,5,"So cute! These stocks are made very well and came quickly, especially considering COVID and Christmas."
PupSocks,2020-12-31T17:52:49Z,1,We still haven’t gotten our order after placing it over a month ago.  It’s still listed as in production.  Funny that I’m being asked to review something I never received.  Very sad about trying this company :(
PupSocks,2020-12-31T17:51:35Z,5,I ordered a face mask with two different headshots of a pet. I was impressed with the quality. They even filled my request to crop the photo.
PupSocks,2020-12-31T17:41:03Z,1,Placed an order 12/4 - still not received.  Email was replied to with an standard response. Keep getting emails trying to get me to buy more - why would I?
PupSocks,2020-12-31T17:39:58Z,3,"I ordered two pairs of socks. I followed the email tracking and it stated both socks were shipped together. I only received one pair in the packaging. This year has been crazy so the actual shipping time was not an issue for me. When I emailed the company to try and get some information about the second pair I got a vague generalized email. I have no idea if the second pair has shipped or not. The one product that I did receive however was very well made, and fun."
PupSocks,2020-12-31T17:30:30Z,3,"These socks are super cool!  I love the way they printed out, and really my only suggested improvement is that the socks fit my feet better.  The fit isn't snug because of the shape of the socks.  Same goes for my wife, as I purchased a second pair for her.  Other than that, they're great!"
PupSocks,2020-12-31T17:26:33Z,5,Love the masks. Wish they arrived before Christmas. The order was placed at the beginning of December.
PupSocks,2020-12-31T17:21:21Z,5,Worked just like I thought it would wife loved them
PupSocks,2020-12-31T17:18:17Z,1,i would love to do a review whether good or bad but pretty hard to when they totally missed the production timelines and the shipping timelines...order on Nov 30 and still havent received them
PupSocks,2020-12-31T17:17:00Z,4,Ordered these for a friend for Christmas and she loved them.
PupSocks,2020-12-31T17:13:59Z,5,"I ordered a blanket for my daughter as a Christmas gift. Our 15 year old Westie had passed over the summer and my daughter was heartbroken. Ordering was easy, quick, professional. I did have a question shortly after placing my order and they were slow to respond but it was just a few weeks before Christmas during a pandemic so I am sure they were busy. Ordered on the 2nd, shipped by the 18th and arrived on the 20th. They even provided a eCard mock up in the event that shipping took longer than expected. The blanket was perfect and brought tears to our eyes when she opened it on Christmas morning. I will be ordering again. Thank you PupSocks."
PupSocks,2020-12-31T17:11:28Z,1,Ordered my socks for a Christmas gift on 11/29 and as of 12/31 still have not received. Would not order if expect to actually receive your item. Stay away.
PupSocks,2020-12-31T17:07:36Z,5,I bought two blankets (with pictures of my cats).  The pics came out great. Nice and clear and the blanket itself is very soft. I’m very happy!
PupSocks,2020-12-31T17:06:10Z,2,Great images but the fabric is a turnoff. Nobody in my family wants to wear them. Would be great if they came in all or mostly cotton.
PupSocks,2020-12-31T17:02:44Z,5,"Love the socks! They are hilarious and my family members that received them as gifts loved them! Also they arrived a day before Christmas, just in time!! Thank you!!"
PupSocks,2020-12-31T17:01:28Z,4,UPDATE: Finally received the socks on 1/4. They look just as advertised.I wish I could comment on the quality of the product but I have yet to receive my order. I ordered 3 pairs of socks with photos of our cats on November 30. It's now December 31 and I have yet to receive them. I realize much if this is due to the Post Office being kneecapped by COVID and its Postmaster. The order's shipping label was created on 12/16. Accepted by USPS on 12/19.
PupSocks,2020-12-31T17:00:58Z,5,What do you say about socks?  My pupsocks are awesome.  Made a great gift for the kids.
PupSocks,2020-12-31T16:59:53Z,5,These are good quality and the picture is very clear. Recommend for sure!
PupSocks,2020-12-31T16:57:26Z,1,The material the socks are made out of is super cheap and the socks aren't sewn right.  They didn't fit my foot like a regular sock would.  So there is no way to wear them!  I want a refund.
PupSocks,2020-12-31T16:48:19Z,4,"I was a little disappointed with the quality of the fabric, it feels a bit cheap. But, the socks were a huge hit with my husband and he didn’t seem to mind the fabric so it worked out."
PupSocks,2020-12-31T16:48:07Z,5,Jeanette Atherton- ordered a blanket. Initially was concerned item would not arrive by Christmas based off tracking number. This was post office error. Item arrived 12/23 In time for Christmas. Very happy with product and delivery.  Expect future orders from us.
PupSocks,2020-12-31T16:43:43Z,1,"Terrible experience with this “company” ordered 12/03/2020.  Many emails trying to find status only automated replies, no phone number listed.  I believe it’s just a scam."
PupSocks,2020-12-31T16:36:50Z,5,Everything was adorable and done in a timely way
PupSocks,2020-12-31T16:35:52Z,5,"My husband and I recently had to put our 18 year old cat to sleep because she had oral cancer. I took one of our favorite pictures of her and ordered a green blanket. It turned out great, and the blanket is super soft!"
PupSocks,2020-12-31T16:34:53Z,1,"Awful. Will now be waiting over a month for my item—which was a intended to be a Christmas gift. I placed my order on December 3rd and they advertised up until December 16-18th to “place you order now and receive it before Christmas.” Total BS as I placed on December 3rd and still don’t have it. I did all my Christmas shopping online this year, and received all my items (except this one) well in advance to Christmas.  They blamed COVID (of course). Total BS company and will be the last time I order anything from an Instagram ad."
PupSocks,2020-12-31T16:23:55Z,1,Website was not updated with needed information. Still have not received order. Customer service never answered my question despite my asking it 3 different ways. Mock up image I received looked laughable. The one request I had was completely ignored. Extremely unhappy with entire process. Still waiting on item.....
PupSocks,2020-12-31T16:18:20Z,3,I wasn’t happy with how long it took for the completion of my order. The website said anywhere from 12-15 days. I ordered the blanket on November 28th.  It wasn’t shipped until December 21st. That is 23 days!! It was Christmas present.  The quality of the blanket Is great. However was very disappointed in how long it took to receive it. I got it yesterday December 30th.  I can not recommend anyone to buy something from your website and expect to receive it in a timely manner.
PupSocks,2020-12-31T16:16:18Z,1,Stated on website any orders placed before december 12th will be delivered by christmas. Placed order on december 3rd. Its now december 31st and still haven't received order. No reply when i contacted them
PupSocks,2020-12-31T16:08:54Z,2,Unfortunately the quality of these socks is very poor and they are hardly wearable. The order took a long time to arrive and it was difficult to g with get in touch with anyone on what the problem was.
PupSocks,2020-12-31T16:07:24Z,2,Ordered a month ago still no package
PupSocks,2020-12-31T16:01:06Z,5,Originally was not happy with crop job. Contacted customer service and was able to get them re-cropped. Love the new product and great customer service. Would recommend to anyone
PupSocks,2020-12-31T15:59:28Z,4,I love the socks. Great quality. Fun presents to give. Very comfy. I could not give 5 stars because my order took a long time to arrive and I am still waiting on my first order. The second one arrived first. I am also waiting on my 50 percent off coupon I was promised when my order was postponed.
PupSocks,2020-12-31T15:58:16Z,5,The socks were an amazing gift.  I would recommend for anyone who has their own pet or a friend/family member who does.  Its also a great way to honor and remember that pet that has already passed.
PupSocks,2020-12-31T15:57:21Z,5,"Love the custom masks I ordered. And more importantly, the recipients were overwhelmed with them. Thanks!"
PupSocks,2020-12-31T15:55:10Z,5,My husband loves his PupSocks that I got him for Christmas!!  They turned out great!
PupSocks,2020-12-31T15:53:00Z,1,I would love to give a good review BUT I haven’t received my order yet! I ordered in November.....
PupSocks,2020-12-31T15:50:02Z,2,"The blanket I order was great! The socks are cute but they don’t fit! I ordered them for my13 year old daughter. She can’t even put them on. There is no stretch. I will never order socks again very disappointed. I should of ordered her a blanket, at least she could of used that."
PupSocks,2020-12-31T15:38:33Z,1,Didn’t recieve my order yet after 3 weeks .I may appreciate the fact that it may not be your fault but it is of course disappointing as I have contacted you and still waiting for a reply .Poor experience so far .
PupSocks,2020-12-31T15:34:35Z,2,"The socks and blanket were disappointing.  The socks are like compression socks?! Not very fuzzy, comfortable or soft.  They are compression socks with my cats face on them. I thought they were going to be a little better quality and softer socks. The blanket?!  The blanket is soft but it’s thinner than a tissue.   For the price of the blanket I was hoping it would’ve been made out of a thicker, cozier material.  It seems the price you charge for these items aren’t for the items at all because the material is cheap.  The price you charge is for whoever copy and pasted my cats face into a computer program.  That’s cool, but then just say these are $3.00 dollar socks and blankets that were putting your pets face on.  The rest of your money goes to us for putting your pets face on things because you can’t.  If this were the case?!Then I would’ve been cool with this order."
PupSocks,2020-12-31T15:29:28Z,5,Love love love my order. They captured exactly what I wanted for the socks and they look great. Quick shipping time too.
PupSocks,2020-12-31T15:23:38Z,2,I was disappointed that the Xmas gift I ordered on Nov 19 has still not arrived as of Dec 31. I ordered from a different company on Nov 26 from the States and it arrived Dec 17. According to the tracking info it has still not arrived in Canada. Not really impressed.
PupSocks,2020-12-31T15:22:53Z,2,"I placed two orders around December 8. I uploaded two pictures per order and inserted a note asking if I could have both pictures printed on the socks. When I got the receipt via email, I only saw 1 picture and I immediately emailed customer service. It took them 5 days to respond and basically told me socks are immediately put in production (I placed the order on a Saturday or Sunday and highly doubt they started working on them that same day). When I got the socks, one pair was fine and the other pair for some reason they decided to cut the picture into two (guessing someone did read my note and misunderstood but didn’t bother emailing me. Also, the picture was of my friend running with her song.). Overall, they get a 2 because customer service was by far the worst. Definitely won’t come back to this company."
PupSocks,2020-12-31T15:19:58Z,5,My husband loved them! He has more pictures of our dog than his children and now the dog's picture is on his socks!
PupSocks,2020-12-31T15:18:32Z,1,Ordered in November and still have not received the product.
PupSocks,2020-12-31T15:16:20Z,5,My Daughter LOVED her pup blanket!!!
PupSocks,2020-12-31T15:12:28Z,1,Ordered on 11/27. Still have not received the items. These are expensive custom socks. They paid for Facebook advertising during the Black Friday shopping week which undoubtedly generated many sales. They say items ship within 2-5 business days. They blame Covid and shipping for the product not arriving in a timely manner. I received a notice on 12/22 saying my items have shipped. They’re still sitting at the company yet to arrive at the shipping center according to the tracking. Big scam! Horrible business practices. Stay clear!
PupSocks,2020-12-31T14:55:21Z,5,I am very pleased with my purchase. The picture came out exactly how I wanted it. Beautifully done!
PupSocks,2020-12-31T14:45:51Z,5,"Easy and simple process, and my daughter LOVED her socks with her dog on them. Thanks PupSocks for an awesome experience!"
PupSocks,2020-12-31T14:43:20Z,5,Highly recommended!  The product was good quality and the photo on our sock order came out amazing. One of the most fun gifts I’ve ever given. My boyfriend absolutely loved it!
PupSocks,2020-12-31T14:42:25Z,3,"Like the idea, but run small (yes I ordered the appropriate size.)  So needless to say was a little disappointed."
PupSocks,2020-12-31T14:39:51Z,1,Slow! Did not get any response to my email. Been over a month and still no socks. Do not order from them!
PupSocks,2020-12-31T14:38:20Z,3,The quality of the material used to make the socks was disappointing.
PupSocks,2020-12-31T14:26:28Z,2,"Service was great, but socks were very poor quality."
PupSocks,2020-12-31T14:21:18Z,5,My husband loved these for a Christmas gift!
PupSocks,2020-12-31T14:19:29Z,5,The pictures on the socks came out exactly like my cats!  Love them so much!
PupSocks,2020-12-31T14:01:56Z,2,"Part of my December 2nd order arrived yesterday, Dec 30th. Still waiting for the rest. USPS is not the problem as everything else I ordered online arrived within 10 days. This company has a good idea but hasn't figured out how to actualize it. The mask that arrived was cute, but quality is similar to what's sold by street vendors, thus expensive for the product but supposedly a small portion goes to charity, so is forgivable."
PupSocks,2020-12-31T14:00:38Z,1,I ordered in November and never received them or any replies to my 5 emails asking where they are......scam company!!!   Do not waste your money!!!!
PupSocks,2020-12-31T13:43:47Z,1,"I’ve waited weeks for this “Christmas present,” which may end up being a Valentine’s Day gift. In 2022. It still isn’t here, but the request for a review arrived. So here you go.Don’t do business with these rip-off artists.  They suck."
PupSocks,2020-12-31T13:30:55Z,3,Shipping was way too long. It’s almost new year and it still not there...
PupSocks,2020-12-31T13:14:36Z,1,Ordered Pup Socks in early December for a Christmas gift... its New Years Eve and still haven’t received them. They claim 5-7 business days but Production takes several weeks. They are also very expensive
PupSocks,2020-12-31T13:13:46Z,1,I never received my order.
PupSocks,2020-12-31T13:03:05Z,5,Love them!  High quality material and the graphics are perfect. Made a great gift for my wife. Keep up the great work!
PupSocks,2020-12-31T12:39:51Z,3,The socks themselves are a weird material and look cheap. Like something from the dollar store.
PupSocks,2020-12-31T12:39:11Z,2,"Received the wrong order.  Was supposed to be 2 cats.  Got a dog and cat.  The correct blanket is very soft, though!"
PupSocks,2020-12-31T12:34:15Z,2,The quality of the blanket is good but gave it 2 stars because the image of my dog did not come out clear. Half the side of the face is smudged and unclear. Contacted the support team about the quality of the image but no one has returned my email.
PupSocks,2020-12-31T12:28:20Z,1,"Extended production delays, non existent customer service, poor quality socks. A complete waste of my time."
PupSocks,2020-12-31T12:10:00Z,2,"The socks look cute but they are completely impractical as they are not shaped to fit a foot correctly and the material is awful like a pair of old mans dress socks. I was expecting cotton, soft socks for the price. I will never buy again."
PupSocks,2020-12-31T11:04:32Z,1,"The socks are cute, of course, because there is a picture of my adorable cat. But the quality of the socks is garbage. It feels like you’re wearing a big plastic bag on your foot. The shape of the sock is a tube and when worn it bunches up on the top of your ankle and makes it uncomfortable to wear. I placed my order on Black Friday and they arrived Dec 29. 😢"
PupSocks,2020-12-31T10:50:43Z,1,"Never received my order, ended up canceling it to days before Christmas.  When I ordered it said guaranteed before Christmas.  Emails were not answered.  Very disappointed I couldn’t get this gift for my daughter.  Finally got an email dais after Christmas saying my order was delivered.  Item was delivered to another state according to the email."
PupSocks,2020-12-31T10:16:25Z,1,The product I receiced is nothing like what I order. They just sent me a random pair.
PupSocks,2020-12-31T07:51:21Z,1,For now it’s 1 star since I haven’t received my orders. One was placed on Dec 1st and the other on the 3rd!!!!  It is now Dec 31st and still not have received my orders.
PupSocks,2020-12-31T07:29:05Z,5,My wife loved the socks and face mask. Her affection for our pups is now ten folds thanks to her ability to wear her everywhere. If we're gonna live in a world where we have to hide our faces it might as well be behind the joy of a pup mask and socks
PupSocks,2020-12-31T06:54:31Z,5,"Great gift, came out perfect and my girlfriend loved them."
PupSocks,2020-12-31T06:47:35Z,1,"Ordered one pair of socks a month ago and still haven’t received them.  20 minutes after ordering I emailed and asked to change the size and was told “it is too late, the product is already in production......”.  If I could have given negative stars, I would."
PupSocks,2020-12-31T05:49:46Z,1,I ordered my pup socks at the end of November and it is December 31st and I still have not received them. I tried contacting them but received no response. I would not recommend this company.
PupSocks,2020-12-31T05:37:26Z,5,"I bought a mask for my step-daughter, with her kitty on it.  She loved it and was very surprised!  Good quality and it turned out really great."
PupSocks,2020-12-31T04:47:16Z,2,"I gifted these socks for my wife who is by all measurements, thin. The socks I got her don't even fit her because she can't get them over her calves. I never thought I would hear her say that socks won't fit past her calves because she doesn't have large calves. I am disappointed."
PupSocks,2020-12-31T04:42:58Z,1,I didnt get what I ordered also they didn't even try to solve the issue with me. Don't buy anything from this store. Its a fake site!!!!
PupSocks,2020-12-31T04:34:37Z,1,The products look great online. I ordered 5 items in early December and have not received any of them. It’s now been about 4 weeks. I have emailed the company 3 times and have only received automated responses which did nothing to help resolve the issue. I am very disappointed because I have not received the socks and masks I ordered and have not received a refund either!  Buyer beware!
PupSocks,2020-12-31T04:28:14Z,5,Exactly as described. Love baby yoda!! Sticks well and have had zero issues!!
PupSocks,2020-12-31T04:13:52Z,1,The socks I ordered and paid for were for my sister with pic of her dog on socks. The morning of Xmas Eve received email from you with mock of order to present bad the gift until they arrived. They arrived Xmas Eve afternoon by USPS. The socks were of a cat. The mock email was of my sister’s dog. I called that afternoon and left the message as no one answered. Maybe left early Xmas Eve day?  Called Monday morning 12/28. A girl answered and connected me to Ext because the one who did shipping was not in. I left message with phone number and they already has my email. Have not heard anything yet......  this was paid through Amazon
PupSocks,2020-12-31T04:07:18Z,1,"This company is a scam and offensive.  They don’t deliver. Do not buy! Then, they try to make up a new order for you even though the holidays ( the reason for the order) are over.  I just want a refund!"
PupSocks,2020-12-31T03:39:42Z,1,Your delivery was late horribly late stupidly late. The blame was put on the post office and you sent a photo of the gift I wanted to give. I ordered with plenty of time to deliver the socks. Understand if you got screwed by the Post office but poor planning on your part to not have additional delivery options available to the customer. If you're going to charge $60 for two pair of socks as a novelty and spend $4 on shipping that's your bad not the post office. Maybe cut your profits a bit and offer more shipping options. The socks were cute but not $60 for two pair and late cute. Good luck hope you all survive this but I won't be a customer again.
PupSocks,2020-12-31T03:31:53Z,5,It was the perfect gift!! Will order again!!
PupSocks,2020-12-31T03:31:12Z,5,Thank you for the socks. They came out great. They were gifts and were loved.
PupSocks,2020-12-31T03:22:51Z,5,Sooo cute and great quality!!  Arrived on time during a crazy busy holiday season!
PupSocks,2020-12-31T03:19:33Z,1,We ordered our product on dec 2nd and still haven’t received it so we can’t really review it.
PupSocks,2020-12-31T03:07:04Z,5,The orange socks with Bailey Sue on them were a big hit. Bailey lives with Brad. Brad is so obsessed with his new socks. They were a big hit and helped make Christmas very special. Thanks Pupsocks. This was my third order. All have been well received.
PupSocks,2020-12-31T03:03:43Z,5,The photos I submitted printed perfectly on the socks with great color and quality.  I gave the socks as gifts and the recipients absolutely loved them.  Customer service was also great with providing updates on order and shipment status.
PupSocks,2020-12-31T02:56:06Z,5,Socks were Amazing!! Great quality and simply adorable!
PupSocks,2020-12-31T02:55:25Z,1,"I still have not received my order from December 2nd. After many attempts to find out when my order would be delivered, I received no response. I emailed, messaged on Instagram and Facebook and got nothing in response. These were Christmas gifts. Very very disappointed."
PupSocks,2020-12-31T02:46:03Z,3,"Very cute gift. However, the material of the socks is less than desirable."
PupSocks,2020-12-31T02:36:57Z,1,"Order on Dec 2, this is Dec 30, still have not received my order. I have repeatedly sent emails to company but all I get back is a generic email. No contact from the company at all. Very poor quality of customer service. Will never order from this company again. Would not recommend to anyone."
PupSocks,2020-12-31T02:35:54Z,5,"The pictures on socks looked great. The quality of the socks is good (not great), but they are comfortable. Recommend highly."
PupSocks,2020-12-31T02:34:57Z,5,These were a gift for husband and he loved them!! Socks are a good quality and fit well.
PupSocks,2020-12-31T02:18:18Z,5,The socks were a perfect Gift. I thought a month from christmas was enough but they arrived a few days late.
PupSocks,2020-12-31T02:16:46Z,5,It was a good idea to send the mock up of what the socks would look like. I finally received them and they are so cute. My friend will love them. The quality is very nice. Thank you.
PupSocks,2020-12-31T02:15:52Z,2,The quality of the image was great but the mask is super small and the strings are super long. Won’t fit comfortably over any adult mouth and nose. Super high quality art and design but useless for an adult to actually wear...
PupSocks,2020-12-31T02:02:12Z,5,They are the cutest socks ever! Love them❤️❤️❤️
PupSocks,2020-12-31T01:50:39Z,1,"I received my package on time! However the package was empty. It looks almost as if the package wasn’t sealed all the way at the factory. I have been trying to get in touch with someone for over week now with no response. I have sent several emails, several chats on the website, reached out through Facebook as well as Instagram with no response. These were a Christmas gift for my father, that I would rather give late than not at all. However I cannot get anyone to respond to me. 😞 very disappointed"
PupSocks,2020-12-31T01:30:11Z,4,"I love the socks, the only problem was shipping delays.  This of course wasn’t the best time of the year for mailing, but I hope you will have better luck with your shipping next year.  The socks didn’t make it in time for Christmas, but it was a wonderful after Christmas addition."
PupSocks,2020-12-31T01:23:06Z,1,I haven’t even received my order yet and it was a Christmas present. I paid for shipping however every time I look at the US PS tracking it does not give me any updated information. I ordered this a month ago and still have not received it however it’s paid for!!!
PupSocks,2020-12-31T01:16:51Z,5,Great socks!
PupSocks,2020-12-31T01:08:34Z,4,The pictures came out great!
PupSocks,2020-12-31T01:08:01Z,1,"I been waiting for 30 days for my order... at this point I am wondering if it's even coming! I tried contacting client services, but only received an automatic response from PupSocks blaming the USPS. Items I ordered from other places arrived on time, so can only wonder if the USPS is really at fault here. I found online I am not the only one in this situation, as there is a warning on the Better Business Bureau against this company."
PupSocks,2020-12-31T00:54:08Z,5,Fast ship and beautiful product! This made my daughter cry happy tears- she lives 1800 miles from her cat and was thrilled to get these socks with her face on them! Well done!!
PupSocks,2020-12-31T00:50:51Z,3,"The face of my daughter's cat was very clear but the mask is so large, it doesn't cover her face. She's 18, not a child, so I didn't expect it to be so oversized and awkward. She won't be able to wear it."
PupSocks,2020-12-31T00:48:54Z,1,I placed my order before thanksgiving and still haven’t received it. Meanwhile my credit card was billed. This was a Christmas gift for my boss.
PupSocks,2020-12-31T00:43:12Z,5,So cute . Imagery excellent .
PupSocks,2020-12-31T00:42:33Z,5,"After a minor shipping blip to no fault of pupsocks, i finally received my blanket.  My mom was overjoyed to receive her gift (a little late).  The pictures were clear and perfectly spaced and the blanket is of good quality and really soft.  I will definitely order something again.  The customer service was forthcoming with information and kept me well-informed of the situation.  Great job!"
PupSocks,2020-12-31T00:42:13Z,2,"I was very unhappy with the quality of these socks. The picture printed very dark and my dog was unrecognizable. I suggest sending a proof of what you will get before producing the order. Then, the actual quality of the socks are very poor. For close to $100 for 4 pair this was definitely not worth it. Very cheaply made"
PupSocks,2020-12-31T00:09:32Z,1,Hard to give a review since I ordered December 4th and still haven’t even received notice they have been shipped!!!! Got sent a post card note saying we can send this if they still haven’t been delivered to recipient yet. Such a joke. Literally have received zero updates from the company but had no problems taking my 50$. I would go with a different company unless you don’t mind waiting months for your stuff to get here.
PupSocks,2020-12-31T00:01:16Z,1,My 10yr old daughter saved her money to buy her brothers masks with our dog’s face on them. We placed the order Dec. 1st. They still haven’t shipped. We cannot get anyone at PupSocks to return our emails. We tried to cancel the order and they will only refund a small portion. Unspeakable customer service and they are literally stealing from a child.
PupSocks,2020-12-31T00:00:07Z,1,Slow to create product and ship. Hope you are not in a hurry.
PupSocks,2020-12-30T23:53:27Z,1,"They sent my brother the incorrect socks (wrong color & wrong animal). I have contacted PupSocks via email and website, both with no reply. Would like sock correction & refund, but can’t seem to get a hold of anyone."
PupSocks,2020-12-30T23:44:37Z,3,"I was disappointed with the combination of my two orders. It was hard to track my orders and both arrived much later than expected, even though I was promised them before Christmas. The quality was also was not what I expected for the price."
PupSocks,2020-12-30T23:26:10Z,1,"Unfortunately I still not have received my order, even though I ordered 4 weeks ago.  I ordered gifts for several people and Christmas was a let down since I didn't have the gifts to give them.  PupSocks advertised that delivery was GUARANTEED by Christmas, but the items didn't arrive and they have not offered any kind of discount or any compensation for this."
PupSocks,2020-12-30T23:01:31Z,1,I wanted socks with my face on them and sent them in a picture which was approved.  My socks arrived with a dog on them and not my face.  I emailed customer service and got a long auto-reply email from them saying they are very busy.  Still haven’t heard back from them. I do not recommend this to anyone
PupSocks,2020-12-30T23:00:03Z,1,"These socks aren’t wearable. The material has no stretch, and my husband couldn’t even get them all the way on his foot. He doesn’t have a large foot."
PupSocks,2020-12-30T22:57:26Z,1,Don't promise lightning fast delivery if you cannot deliver on time. Still waiting for the package I ordered on Dec 2.
PupSocks,2020-12-30T22:51:59Z,5,Perfect socks!
PupSocks,2020-12-30T22:50:38Z,4,"The image of the pup turned out better than expected and the socks were a huge hit on Christmas morning. My only criticisms would be that a wider variety of colors would have been nice, and the quality of the socks themselves could be better, but I would definitely give the socks as gifts again."
PupSocks,2020-12-30T22:40:05Z,1,Ordered on the 5th and wasnt sent till the 23rd and still hasn't arrived. 20 emails were sent to me about deals but not one with an update on the order. Had nothing to give my partner for Christmas. Couldn't tell you what the product is like cause after 26 days it still hasn't arrived.
PupSocks,2020-12-30T22:35:51Z,2,The socks don’t even have the shape of feet... not confortable and the quality is poor
PupSocks,2020-12-30T22:29:36Z,4,"The socks are very cute. Unfortunately, they were ordered on December 2nd but didn't arrive until after Christmas on December 27th.  Someone didn't have a gift to open on Christmas Day."
PupSocks,2020-12-30T22:25:55Z,1,"Single worst customer experience of my life. Some minor issue with order and they could not correct. Instructed me to cancel order which I did. Hit me with a $27 cancellation fee. Really? FU. No phone number, no live humans. Crap start up company And it shows."
PupSocks,2020-12-30T22:20:35Z,1,"I ordered in November, anticipating that it would be no problem to have it arrive for Christmas.  Still no sign of what I ordered, a week after Christmas.  Perhaps quicker manufacturing would be in order, rather than blaming the postal service.  Would appreciate if you would follow up."
PupSocks,2020-12-30T22:17:39Z,1,"Honestly I was really disappointed with my order. I spent over $50 on two pairs of socks as gifts. Even though I ordered them on Dec 1st, they didn’t arrive until late in the day in the 24th, after I had already left That morning. So I couldn’t even give them as presents. When they did arrive, the quality was much less than I would have hoped. And most importantly, they didn’t look like the order images from the website. I had 2 pictures on each sock, and instead of alternating in a decorative pattern, there was simply one column of one pic and another Column of the other pic. It didn’t look nearly as nice.  For having spent $52 on two pairs of socks, I was really disappointed."
PupSocks,2020-12-30T22:15:58Z,1,"I ordered my items in December 2nd, the shipping information made it seem like getting them by Christmas would be no problem. They didn’t ship until the 19th and I STILL don’t have them. I also have emailed two times and have never heard back from anyone. I definitely won’t be ordering from this site again, and who knows if I’ll ever even get my items that I spent $50 on."
PupSocks,2020-12-30T22:15:22Z,5,Sooooo cute!!!!
PupSocks,2020-12-30T22:12:59Z,1,"The image is over pixelated and looks like a black blob instead of a dogs face.  I have reached out to customer service, but got and email that they are very busy and will get back to me as soon as possible.  Hopefully they will be able to make this right."
PupSocks,2020-12-30T22:12:56Z,1,These were not even sock shaped!! They bunch up around your ankles and are really wide and flat at the toes. A disappointing result at the end of a long wait.
PupSocks,2020-12-30T22:12:43Z,1,If I could give no stars I would. What a scam. You advertise that the socks will be delivered in 15 business days. What a lie and yet you still advertised relentlessly about having them ready for Christmas. I canceled my order that was never delivered. I will never recommend your company.
PupSocks,2020-12-30T22:10:59Z,1,"I ordered a pair of socks on November 28th, and they did not arrive until December 30th. I opened the package, and it isn’t even the right pair of socks in it. They are the wrong color and have a completely different animal on there. Very disappointing."
PupSocks,2020-12-30T22:09:38Z,1,This company is a bunch of crooks.Not only did the socks not make it here in time for Christmas! They sent me the wrong socks!! I am sooo angry! I'll be sending them their socks back and they better refund my money Don't waste your time or money.  I'll be contacting the business bureau for their area and putting in a complaint !
PupSocks,2020-12-30T22:05:41Z,1,"Ordered socks on December 1 as a Christmas present. PupSocks didn't even start processing the order until the week of Christmas. Meanwhile they kept sending me emails up til the 20th saying I could order more stuff and have it all by the New Year. Here we are, at the new year and they still haven't shipped the socks I ordered a month ago. Horrible company with a product that you can order at a dozen other companies. Look elsewhere if you want pictures of your pets printed on socks!"
PupSocks,2020-12-30T22:01:31Z,5,"Quick service, great product."
PupSocks,2020-12-30T22:01:11Z,1,"In future, make sure you send your review request after the product actually gets here."
PupSocks,2020-12-30T22:00:41Z,5,Socks came out great and looked just how they were advertised. The only problem that I had which isn't their fault was shipping delays due to usps but thankfully they still came on Christmas eve just in time!
PupSocks,2020-12-30T21:59:21Z,5,"Great socks, arrived quickly, son and husband loved getting our puppy's face on their socks."
PupSocks,2020-12-30T21:56:04Z,5,These socks were perfect! Exactly what I was expecting.
PupSocks,2020-12-30T21:55:32Z,1,I ordered these socks on 12/2 and supposedly they went into production on 12/3. That was nearly month ago and still no order. I ordered them as Christmas gifts well in advance of the deadline but here I am still with nothing from my order and no update on when I can expect them. Beyond disappointed in this process!
PupSocks,2020-12-30T21:54:37Z,1,Ordered on December 2. It is December 30 and I’m still waiting.
PupSocks,2020-12-30T21:54:35Z,1,"Pretty sure the makers of these socks have never actually worn socks. Somehow they were both too big and too small at the same time. There is no actual heel space, so you're basically just putting your foot in an ill-fitting tube. I guess I'll use them as a cleaning rag?"
PupSocks,2020-12-30T21:51:15Z,3,"Picture quality is nice, actual socks are not very comfy. I gave a pair of pupsocks to my girlfriend with our cat's face on it. She thought it was hilarious and loved it but she probably will never actualy wear them because of the weird ""rubbery"" texture of the sock far less comfortable than even cheap cotton socks. Funny gift but not really worth it."
PupSocks,2020-12-30T21:49:14Z,1,"I never received my order (the bag arrived ripped and empty) and despite multiple attempts to reach out to the company I received no response, replacement, or refund."
PupSocks,2020-12-30T21:44:16Z,2,"Order placed on 12/8 and didn't arrived until 12/29.  The quality of the socks is poor. It is a strange square-ish shape in the foot, the material has a very fake polyester feel to it and they do not stretch to fit well on the ankle.  Not socks you would actually want to wear. The picture came out cute and glad it supports the Humane Society but I would not order from PupSocks again."
PupSocks,2020-12-30T21:42:02Z,5,Really happy with the images quality and materials. Made my family really happy with this surprise and planning on ordering more socks for other peoples.
PupSocks,2020-12-30T21:40:43Z,2,I ordered a blanket and socks and they are beautiful but the socks had a small hole & catch in the stitching when I received them.
PupSocks,2020-12-30T21:39:59Z,2,"At first glance, the socks look great. The photo cropping was done perfectly and the screen print is good. The sock material is a bit odd and not particularly comfortable. The size L sock fits okay on my partner (men's size 12-13 feet) but the size S sock fits terribly on my own (women's size 7) - the toe is super wide with about an inch extra fabric on both sides. The crew ankle/calf part of the sock was too tight for both of us."
PupSocks,2020-12-30T21:37:38Z,5,Great blanket! Super soft and I like the large size because it covers me completely.
PupSocks,2020-12-30T21:36:50Z,3,I Love the picture quality and how fun the idea is.The problem is that the sock itself is not wearable I had hoped they would be worn by those who own the pets.But we are very grateful for the gifts and will look at blankets or other items in the future.
PupSocks,2020-12-30T21:36:34Z,1,Ordered them over a month ago and have emailed multiple times and heard nothing back
PupSocks,2020-12-30T21:35:21Z,1,Ordered in November intending them as a Christmas gift. It’s Dec 30 and Ive yet to receive them.
PupSocks,2020-12-30T21:31:03Z,1,I ordered the pup socks in early December and have yet to receive them. No discount on my current order. Never again!
PupSocks,2020-12-30T21:29:28Z,4,Socks bunch at the front part of the ankle.
PupSocks,2020-12-30T21:19:44Z,5,My boy loves his cat and this was the perfect gift for him!
PupSocks,2020-12-30T21:19:17Z,1,20 days for item to be sent to the post office. 2.5 weeks to answer an email. Looks like almost 2 months before item will arrive from order date.
PupSocks,2020-12-30T21:19:07Z,5,We love the blanket with our puppy on it!! My daughter wasn’t as thrilled with the socks said she didn’t like the material. That’s ok I’ll wear them! Just wish they arrived before Christmas.
PupSocks,2020-12-30T21:15:42Z,5,Very cute and the picture was perfect on them.  I had a bit of difficulty with the order and wound up with two pairs but it was a happy error
PupSocks,2020-12-30T21:15:23Z,1,I received the wrong socks and have reached out but not received a response.
PupSocks,2020-12-30T21:14:54Z,1,"I understand that COVID delays are happening for everyone and that's not the issue. The issue is they promised 8-10 biz day shipping and it's been over 30 days since I have placed my order ($55 for TWO pairs of socks, and that was a SALE) and there has been no communication as to a status update. If they were going to be so backed up, perhaps they should have let the customers know and/or stopped taking orders.Also - customer service takes 3 days to get back to you."
PupSocks,2020-12-30T21:13:30Z,1,Still waiting.  Exactly a month since I ordered.  So much for 8-10 business days!  Don't order from here if you want it by a certain date.  They will blame it on covid.
PupSocks,2020-12-30T21:13:14Z,5,"They came out so great, I love them! They were a gift for my boyfriend and he is so happy with how they came out!"
PupSocks,2020-12-30T21:11:07Z,1,"After long wait due to postal delays - which are not their fault, we got the totally wrong order with the photo of a dog we’ve never seen before. I’m hoping it will be made right at some point but the customer service department is overwhelmed. I’m guessing this is $25 I’ll never see again. Clever idea but seems to have gotten too big too soon for this company."
PupSocks,2020-12-30T21:04:51Z,5,Exactly what I wanted. Two pairs of high quality socks with very clear images.
PupSocks,2020-12-30T21:00:03Z,5,"Great gift idea, easy to order, came in when expected, love it!"
PupSocks,2020-12-30T20:56:16Z,1,I ordered green socks with a photo of a dog. I got white socks with a cat. I’ve been trying to email your company but it keeps coming back after a couple of days that it can’t be delivered.
PupSocks,2020-12-30T20:52:01Z,5,Everyone loved their PupSocks!!!!
PupSocks,2020-12-30T20:51:04Z,2,"The socks were filthy.After placing order in November, received the items at 4:30pm on 12/24, but the socks were filthy dirty.  The bag that contained the items was torn, and the socks obviously fell out at some point.  I understand packages can be damaged, but why would they ship items unprotected and not in their own bags?  Disappointed."
PupSocks,2020-12-30T20:42:53Z,2,"The buying process was simple, and the photo I submitted of my dog printed well. However, the fabric of the socks is just weird. They are not very stretchy, so they bunch up on the front of the ankles. Cute idea, but not practical for socks to actually wear."
PupSocks,2020-12-30T20:37:58Z,1,As of December 30th I've not received my order that was placed on Dec 2nd... this was a Christmas gift.
PupSocks,2020-12-30T20:34:43Z,1,"I still await for an order placed 12/2/20 with a delivery commitment well before Christmas. They sent a message 12/11/20 saying there was a ""technical error that occured (their misspelling) when you placed your order causing some details to process improperly.""  Further ""All domestic orders will be shipped via USPS or Fedex prior to their deadlines and if you do not receive your order by Christmas, please reach out to us so we can make it right."" I received a USPS tracking number on 12/18 that has not showed any new updates since 4 days ago 12/26/20 the day it was supposedly going to be delivered. Pupsocks sends out lovely automated messages when I reach out explaining they are inundated so to expect a delayed response. So far no response to my messages. The product looks marvelous but I may never know and would discourage others from ""inundating"" them further."
PupSocks,2020-12-30T20:34:21Z,4,"The photos of the dog on the socks was great--very clear and identifiable.  My only problem was that the color of the blue socks was actually powder blue, not true blue as it looked on the color choices."
PupSocks,2020-12-30T20:32:22Z,5,Picture came out wonderful. My wife loved her socks!
PupSocks,2020-12-30T20:30:11Z,1,Ordered them Dec 2nd. Never received them. Last usps ‘update’ was from Dec 23rd. Please contact me to resolve.
PupSocks,2020-12-30T20:29:34Z,3,My review isn’t based on quality because I haven’t received my product yet. I think it is the USPS’s fault because I ordered on December 2 and the package sat for a long time in the pre-shipment status with no updates. I contacted both Pup Socks and the USPS and didn’t get any info other than a form letter from PupSocks. My package did arrive before Xmas but the envelope was empty. I’ve heard nothing back from Pip Socks yet on this issue but they did send me a printable version of the design that I could print out for my gift recipient.
PupSocks,2020-12-30T20:28:17Z,5,"So cute!!   My daughter loved them, the socks were perfection and the service was great"
PupSocks,2020-12-30T20:27:54Z,1,"If I could review a zero, I would!! I ordered ONE pair of socks on December 1. The shipping label mas made on December 8. Then nothing. I contacted USPS and they said that a label had been created but there was no record of the package actually being sent. Today is December 30. This was SUPPOSED to be a Christmas present for my daughter. Now all it is is a headache! I have sent 5 emails only to get the same robo response about how the USPS is having problems, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH. This apparently is NOT the Postal Service's fault. I would LOVE to get an actual response from an actual human being. I don't see a phone number so I can't contact YOU. So, in short, your customer service sucks and your response, or lack thereof, is ridiculous. In the robo response it said that you get THOUSANDS of emails a day-maybe that should have tipped me off. Oh, and my password doesn't work for my account any more. Did you close it after the second email?"
PupSocks,2020-12-30T20:24:18Z,2,The socks weren’t what I expected. Seemedto be like medical compression socks and were very wide. Fabric wasn’t like a normal sock. The graphic did look good.
PupSocks,2020-12-30T20:22:47Z,1,You sent me someone else’s order.  1 week later you finally responded and asked me for photos of what I received.  I sent those a week ago and I have heard NOTHING BACK.  I WANT A REFUND
PupSocks,2020-12-30T20:22:14Z,1,"It is really difficult to leave a positive review when I placed my order on December 2, being told I would receive it within 14 business days, then the items didn't even ship until December 19th and have not moved since. I contacted customer service on December 23 and have not received a reply (except for generic, automated ones). I purchased these items as gifts and have been left completely in the dark. However I keep getting emails asking me to purchase more, and to leave this review, which are very frustrating. I am preparing to make a claim through PayPal to try and get my money back. Very disappointing experience."
PupSocks,2020-12-30T20:10:59Z,3,"Still waiting for socks I ordered four weeks ago... I know it's the holidays and all, and we missed Christmas, but now we're headed into the new year and I'm still waiting... I never received notice that they shipped, only that a label was created.  Seems like something fell thru the cracks along the way.  They did respond to my emails, but not sure there's anything I can do at this point. Bummer."
PupSocks,2020-12-30T20:09:34Z,4,"Gave a pair of socks to my sister for Christmas,  and she loved them. Other than the texture of the socks being weird, the socks came out great!"
PupSocks,2020-12-30T20:07:33Z,5,The 2 dogs on the pair of socks looked exactly like the pictures I submitted.  It was a lovable present to give.
PupSocks,2020-12-30T20:06:05Z,1,Ordered the socks December 2nd for a Christmas gift.  Here it is almost New Years Eve & no socks.  You have my $$$ but I have nothing
PupSocks,2020-12-30T20:05:33Z,5,Adorable and nice quality!
PupSocks,2020-12-30T20:04:05Z,5,"Got socks and a mask as a gift to my wife - she LOVED them as I chose the face of our cute golden retriever puppy for both.  She loved the colors and the comfort.  The only problem I had was they arrived 2 days after Christmas, despite ordering them one month prior to the holidays...."
PupSocks,2020-12-30T20:03:47Z,1,Half my order was right.  Arrived late.  Crap customer support.
PupSocks,2020-12-30T20:02:12Z,1,Still haven’t got order ! And just a generic email response with no signature from ceo ...what’s there name who wrote email? There is no phone number either to calland talk to someone . Ordered DEC 1 .. if you are blaming the post office why did you keep sending orders out that way ?? Still waiting for response
PupSocks,2020-12-30T20:01:30Z,1,"I ordered nov 20th, it is 12/30 and I still have not received order. In addition to this, I reached out to customer service and received only a generic email that says USPS is to blame, they are busy and will get back to us later. I am still waiting for a reply and my order! There is no way to call them directly"
PupSocks,2020-12-30T20:01:03Z,5,Looked great
PupSocks,2020-12-30T19:54:10Z,1,"I am sure they will be great, however I have not received my order yet. Tracking says it is still in Miami."
PupSocks,2020-12-30T19:53:20Z,5,"These are adorable! I was concerned about whether my dog's dark face would transfer to the socks, but the face on the socks looks just like the face in the pic! So cute!"
PupSocks,2020-12-30T19:49:27Z,1,Still waiting was suppose to be for Christmas and my husband dog died and the blanket was his gift
PupSocks,2020-12-30T19:46:37Z,5,Blanket was excellent! Delivery was smooth!
PupSocks,2020-12-30T19:43:18Z,5,"There were troubles getting the order in time for Christmas, but understandable in the age of Covid.  I am very impressed with the quality of the blanket with my pup's photo.  The picture came out great and the blanket is very soft and cuddly. My daughter is moving out of state and can now still snuggle with her pup.  We are both very pleased."
PupSocks,2020-12-30T19:42:14Z,5,Pupsocks did a great job! The socks were a gift and my friend loves them!
PupSocks,2020-12-30T19:41:42Z,1,Never received the socks and never had anyone from the company contact me even after i sent 3 emails. Very disappointed
PupSocks,2020-12-30T19:41:10Z,3,Prob should have ordered way before Christmas...
PupSocks,2020-12-30T19:37:37Z,4,"Socks turned out great. But you sent them in a package, during the holidays, with the name of your company. Kinda ruins the surprise of the gift"
PupSocks,2020-12-30T19:36:28Z,1,"Terrible communication, and I doubt I'll ever receive the product. Order was placed early December, got an email saying it was shipped December 8th, the tracking information hasn't updated since then.I tried to contact them via email, Instagram, Facebook and Twitter only to be ignored, like so many others.When someone finally responded to me weeks after I tried to make contact, they couldn't even get my name right (this wasn't a typo, it was a completely different name). They proceeded to blame USPS for being extremely busy, and courier companies, and took no ownership over the thousands of unhappy customers posting all over their social media about not receiving orders, receiving the wrong ones, and being ignored.The customer service has been terrible, will never use them again and recommend all avoid them."
PupSocks,2020-12-30T19:35:29Z,5,I bought the large blanket and it was excellent quality and customer service! My son said it was his best gift ever. Even though it was delivered by USPS after Christmas it was definitely worth the wait and not the fault of PupSocks. Highly recommend!!
PupSocks,2020-12-30T19:35:22Z,5,Socks looked exactly as I hoped! Our pup’s face turned out very well. Sock colors were vibrant.
PupSocks,2020-12-30T19:34:50Z,5,We ordered a set of two personalized socks for my parents for Hanukkah this year. They LOVED them. Their adorable puppy Ace is sooo cute we knew he deserved his own socks. Best gift this year. They FaceTimed all my aunts and uncles to show off the socks. These socks made Hanukkah during COVID something joyful to remember. Thank you!!
PupSocks,2020-12-30T19:34:42Z,5,"These are super cute and great quality. They were an awesome gift. I received them in time for Christmas, but the USPS was really backed up so PupSocks sent me printable mock-ups in case the real thing didn’t arrive in time. I truly appreciated that extra effort. Great service! Will definitely use again."
PupSocks,2020-12-30T19:33:46Z,1,Despite ordering nov 27 2020 i still have not received my package today is December 30
PupSocks,2020-12-30T19:33:26Z,1,"One of the worst experiencies I had buying online.I tried several times to contact pupsocks without success, I made the purchase on December 2, supposedly it was dispatched on December 4 but when following up the order does not progress, I wrote to them to ask and they prefer to remain silent. Thanks for nothing."
PupSocks,2020-12-30T19:32:48Z,5,These stocks were great. The picture turned out better than I thought it would . My only complaint & maybe it’s my fault. I don’t know..... this was a Christmas present & the package arrived with pup socks brand all over the bag. Cool bag but it was a gift. I’m glad my wife didn’t see the bag or it would’ve been a dead giveaway. Maybe I missed the place to check that it was a gift??
PupSocks,2020-12-30T19:29:51Z,5,I got the socks for my daughter.  She loved them! Said they where her favorite gift! Lol
PupSocks,2020-12-30T19:27:04Z,1,"It took over a month to get my order, then when I did, it was the wrong picture/socks. I’ve tried calling and emailing, but no one has gotten back to me to try to correct this. Awful experience."
PupSocks,2020-12-30T19:22:09Z,1,Highly unsatisfied. I ordered for my kids and ordered their correct sizes and the socks are huge and strange. They dont even form to your foot. The print turned out good but my girls cant wear them due to the quality of the sock. Overpriced and would not recommend.
PupSocks,2020-12-30T19:19:16Z,1,"I was told that there would be a delay on my product. Which I understood. Then it showed my product shipped but, the tracking didn’t actually show anything. After a week of there being a tracking number with no movement I reached out just to make sure that the shipping company had not just lost my package. I got no response. Then over a week later it showed some action on the tracking number and was here the next day. The wrong product was in the package. I got someone else’s socks. I have reached out a few times, with no response. I understand that it is a busy time of year and am fine with the delay in the gift but, some acknowledgment letting me know that they received my message would be nice. Am I out the money I spent? Do I just start wearing socks with a random cat on it? Will I get my socks with the dog? Will someone read my email?"
PupSocks,2020-12-30T19:19:05Z,1,When ordered on December 1st I was told it would be 8-10 day turnaround.  It is now December 30th and I still dont have my order.  I wish I had never ordered from you and plan on filing a complaint with better business bureau.  Your policy of not offering a full refund had I decided to cancel my order is just the icing on the cake.  Not to mention I kept receiving numerous emails after I placed my order telling me to order more and get my purchase in time for Christmas...LIES AND FALSE ADVERTISEMENT!
PupSocks,2020-12-30T19:14:44Z,1,I haven’t received my order yet and I placed it almost a month ago. No communication or reply to my message inquiring where it is. You know usps is a mess; figure out a solution that doesn’t leave your customers without gifts! 0/10 would not recommend.
PupSocks,2020-12-30T19:09:02Z,5,They came out perfect. And my husband loved them! Customer service is phenomenal and like no other I have ever seen. They made a mock-up when my socks didn’t get here on time and still made it special!
PupSocks,2020-12-30T19:07:16Z,3,"The print of my dog it wonderful and great coloring. But the sock itself is like a tube, it does not have form to fit your foot like a normal sock. Bunches is strange spots."
PupSocks,2020-12-30T19:05:41Z,1,Kind of hard to give a review since I never received the socks...
PupSocks,2020-12-30T19:03:48Z,1,I still have not received my order of socks that was placed on Dec 1!  I was sent the wrong socks (purple with cat ) instead of my white socks with my dog! No one will return my emails or fix this error and mess! It looks like this is happening to others also according to a group on Facebook of dissatisfied customers! You take our money and don’t send our purchase! Sham company!!
PupSocks,2020-12-30T18:46:36Z,1,These socks are horrible! They don’t stretch to get your door into them. I paid $89 for 4 pairs of socks that I can’t even wear! I was so excited to get these only for them to be cheaply made. What a disappointment. I wish I could have a full refund.
PupSocks,2020-12-30T18:44:56Z,5,Great product! True to size. Quality images; my photos transferred just fine.
PupSocks,2020-12-30T18:44:42Z,1,Have not received my order yet.  And from the photos you sent of the socks they look very amateurish.  I will never use your company again.
PupSocks,2020-12-30T18:09:59Z,1,"I ordered my socks on November 29th and they still have not gotten here (a month after I ordered them). PupSocks has said that it is the USPS's fault, but there are so many people with late orders that I can't believe it is solely the USPS's fault. Also, there was a ""technical error"" after I ordered the socks, so the production was delayed a whole week, which I assume delayed my production even longer. When I contacted customer service and asked to speak with someone on the PupSocks team, they just sent me a general email and later a ""mock-up"" of the socks that I could show to the person I was giving the gift. If the company would get in touch with me (or if the socks arrived and were good quality), maybe I would see them in a better light. Don't trust this company, take your money elsewhere."
PupSocks,2020-12-30T18:08:17Z,5,I love my socks! They are so fun! The photo that I uploaded looks very clear on the socks. My goldfish loves to see himself on my socks.
PupSocks,2020-12-30T18:02:21Z,1,Delivery time promised was not achieved. Order showed as 'in production' for weeks and there was no communication regarding the delay. The product was not delivered before Christmas even though I ordered it a month prior to Christmas.
PupSocks,2020-12-30T17:51:43Z,5,My fiance' was so pleased with with quality of this unique blanket and the feel of the fabric. Was her favorite gift of Christmas!
PupSocks,2020-12-30T17:49:14Z,5,It was a hit for Christmas!! My son loves them
PupSocks,2020-12-30T17:43:57Z,5,"Oh, my goodness! Dad SQUEALED when he opened his Christmas stocking and found the PURFECT pair of custom PupSocks with his two Aussies' faces looking back at him!!! It was the BEST gift of Christmas!!!!"
PupSocks,2020-12-30T17:41:38Z,1,"Not worth it. Socks ordered 12/1, and didn’t ship until 12/18 with no response to inquiries until the day after they shipped. The socks arrived with the correct cat faces, but the quality is low - they’re thin, have an unpleasant plastic odor, and are not sized properly. I ordered women’s small and these things are enormous! For the price, these are terrible. Will not order from pupsocks again."
PupSocks,2020-12-30T17:40:07Z,5,Blanket came out awesome!!
PupSocks,2020-12-30T17:39:47Z,1,I have no idea about the product because it still hasn't arrived from when I ordered it on Nov 25.  I'm disappointed as it stated on your website it would arrive in time for Christmas.
PupSocks,2020-12-30T17:38:27Z,1,"Not what I was expecting when I ordered socks... The printing of the cat’s faces was good, but they don’t have the shape of a sock. It’s just a rectangular piece of fabric and it’s not comfortable to wear."
PupSocks,2020-12-30T17:27:45Z,5,Great quality!
PupSocks,2020-12-30T17:26:20Z,1,I received the incorrect socks. I have emailed multiple times to try and get a refund or have the socks redone correctly. No response. Very disappointed and would not suggest ordering from this company. I ordered 4 pairs and they were all wrong. Very unhappy
PupSocks,2020-12-30T17:10:26Z,1,"Hi:I don’t know if you can truly understand the disappointment my daughter and I felt today when our order we waited over a month to receive arrived but it was the WRONG order!! We obviously received someone else’s order as the dog on the socks we got is NOT our Ferbie.How are you going to fix this for us? If you can’t solve this please reimburse me the total cost of the product. Sincerely,Lori Jackman"
PupSocks,2020-12-30T17:06:34Z,5,My husband loves the blanket!
PupSocks,2020-12-30T16:52:02Z,5,Ordering was very easy and the images look great on the socks. Very happy with everything from start to finish. My wife loved getting them for Christmas!
PupSocks,2020-12-30T16:41:57Z,5,"It was perfect, my wife loved it!  I wish the fabric was more comfortable, or you had no show socks available as well, but great overall!"
PupSocks,2020-12-30T16:29:03Z,2,"I ordered 4 pairs of socks in November, hoping they would arrive in time for Christmas. Even with a week's delay due to COVID they should have still made it on time. However I have yet to receive my parcel. I contacted the customer service team who took 10 days to reply. They came back with a different tracking number than the one previously sent out with no explanation. It looks like my package wasnt sent when I received the notification e-mail but a week later. No communication about it being delayed or the timelines not being met. The socks are not cheap and I expected better service."
PupSocks,2020-12-30T16:22:59Z,4,"The socks looked great! They are not quite as comfortable as I thought they would be, but the quality is still great. I would buy again!"
PupSocks,2020-12-30T16:21:16Z,1,"I would give you a review, but i purchased pup socks a month ago and still have not received them. They were supposed to be here Dec 17th before Christmas, and im still waiting....... So nice of you to send me a review survey before i even get the product!"
PupSocks,2020-12-30T16:11:03Z,5,"Quick easy ordering, got our order promptly, perfect christmas gift and such a hit with the family!"
PupSocks,2020-12-30T16:09:51Z,1,"The fabric for these socks is cheap, stiff and uncomfortable"
PupSocks,2020-12-30T16:08:47Z,1,"No indication of delays in orders, received confirmation email that my order would be delivered in 8-10 days. It has now been a month with no sign of my order. Also sent two separate emails 3 weeks ago with no response. Awful customer service and deceptive order dates. Haven’t received the product yet but would not effect my rating. Use one of the other companies that do the same exact thing."
PupSocks,2020-12-30T15:53:35Z,1,"I ordered 4 pair of pupsocks on 11/22/20.As of today, 12/30/20 I have yet to receive the ordered socks.I have no new info from the USPS other than the delivery would be delayed past 12/7/20.Responses to my inquiries to your company have not been helpful at all.You sent me mockups of my order that I could send to the people who were supposed to get a present at Christmas.Why would I send them a mock-up of their present that as of today I do not believe I will receive .I have contacted my credit card company to investigate this order as hoax.I want to be refunded my $.Anne Marie Walsh"
PupSocks,2020-12-30T15:48:43Z,1,"My order was completely wrong. I ordered a pink blanket with my two dogs on it. I got a blue blanket with a dog and a cat on it. To top it all off, when I attempted to reach out for assistance almost a week ago, I was completely ignored."
PupSocks,2020-12-30T15:27:27Z,2,The masks were too small and vey thin.  Not good for covering an adult mans face. They also have no elastic or wire to stay around the nose. I’m afraid they’re not usable. I expected much higher quality
PupSocks,2020-12-30T15:22:46Z,4,"The socks were a hit!  The print was great, the colors were great, and shipping was fast.  4 stars because the quality of the socks was not that great (feel a little weird on).  However, I would order again and will probably order more."
PupSocks,2020-12-30T15:20:04Z,5,Loved the socks I purchased for my husband!  His favorite pair of socks for sure!  Now I just need a pair for myself!!!
PupSocks,2020-12-30T15:17:55Z,1,"Company isn't delivering orders nor responding to customer complaints, nor dispute resolution inquiries. They seem to either be having a complete meltdown, or were a sham company to begin with. Avoid."
PupSocks,2020-12-30T15:15:01Z,1,Never received my order. Reached out to customer service and only got an automated reply.
PupSocks,2020-12-30T15:13:24Z,3,"The socks were a Christmas gift and they were awesome.  Shipping seemed to take a long time compared to what the website said.  So they arrived late.   I didn't want a gift box nor wanted to pay for it but that was the only way I could make the purchase, which was annoying.  The overall price for one pair of socks was almost $40 which was high.  I won't purchase any more because of these things.  It's not the product, I liked the product."
PupSocks,2020-12-30T15:10:13Z,2,Quality of fabric is very poor and feels like plastic. I’m am not sure if you can actually wear these socks for a day. The fit is 2 out of 10 as it seems that 2 rectangular pcs were put together: heel is not accommodated for. Good photo printing quality. Socks lock design and fit.
PupSocks,2020-12-30T15:09:41Z,5,"The socks are so cute, and my brother and sister-in-law loved them."
PupSocks,2020-12-30T15:05:07Z,1,"I was so disappointed : Socks are not comfortable: only a straight tube, no heel."
PupSocks,2020-12-30T15:02:45Z,1,"I placed my first order well before Thanksgiving. The turnaround time was not as advertised. When I finally receive the order the socks had images of random dogs, not the images that I ordered. It wasn’t until I contacted BBB that Pupsocks replaced the socks. I received the second pair on 12/27 And again there were images of random dogs, not the images I ordered. I should have done my homework prior to ordering and read the reviews and checked BBB because they have a “F” rating."
PupSocks,2020-12-30T14:54:52Z,3,"Socks are nice quality and look great, but are too small for a men’s 14 shoe size."
PupSocks,2020-12-30T14:50:50Z,5,Perfect! My wife love them!
PupSocks,2020-12-30T14:50:50Z,1,If I could give them no stars I would. Ordered my daughters blanket on Nov 17th. Still haven’t received it. Get one email saying it’s USPS fault! But funny it hasn’t even shipped yet. Still says it’s in production! Won’t order from this company again. 😡😡😡😡😡😡
PupSocks,2020-12-30T14:50:21Z,5,Love the socks! Great quality for the price.
PupSocks,2020-12-30T14:48:59Z,1,"DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY, FOR THE PRICE THE QUALITY SUCKS."
PupSocks,2020-12-30T14:21:24Z,1,Didn’t arrive within the time they said
PupSocks,2020-12-30T14:13:23Z,1,"Shipping times are beyond ridiculously late. Ordered and label created 12/12/2020. The package was not picked up for 5 additional days, and finally received 12/29/2020. Four days after Christmas. The sock itself is under average material but the printed portion is good. I would not recommend or purchase again."
PupSocks,2020-12-30T14:07:39Z,4,The socks themselve are great and the image of our dog on them is super cute. It's a little disappointing that it took over a month to arrive and was late for Christmas as it was a gift. Though due to the delays this year due to Covid it's not totally unreasonable.
PupSocks,2020-12-30T13:57:26Z,5,"My daughter absolutely LOVES her face mask with her sweet chocolate lab, Jimmy on it!!"
PupSocks,2020-12-30T13:43:54Z,1,Ordered in November and still do not have them. Shipping tracker says January 4th. When I ordered it said I would receive the socks in 10 days. Try a month before they even shipped.  I do not care if they are cute. You let me down as I did not have these for Christmas as told I would. They are too expensive to order again and not know If I will receive them. Very disappointing.
PupSocks,2020-12-30T13:38:14Z,1,Ordered face masks for Christmas presents on December 3. Still have not received them and it is now the 30th. Very disappointed.
PupSocks,2020-12-30T13:35:38Z,5,We LOVED the socks! They were perfect!
PupSocks,2020-12-30T13:35:06Z,3,"I placed an order in November for a Christmas present and got to emails stating I would get them in 8-10 days. 10 days came and went, I emailed several times with no response trying to get an update. Very frustrating! It finally showed up 2 days after Christmas. The product is great but the customer service sucks! Communication is key. If someone would’ve just said it would be late I could’ve wrapped a fake present saying it’s coming. But at that point I didn’t know if they would be delivered or not."
PupSocks,2020-12-30T13:29:01Z,5,"These are super cute! Pet lovers in your life should be excited to get these as a gift. It does take them a couple weeks to make and ship, so plan accordingly if you plan to give them as a gift."
PupSocks,2020-12-30T12:50:16Z,1,I have not received my order that i placed a month ago. I have not heard back from customer service for a resolution and i have reached out several times.
PupSocks,2020-12-30T12:38:51Z,5,I bought the large blanket. Excellent quality. So soft & cozy. It blew my boyfriend away! Turned out to be his favorite gift of all. I can’t recommend the blanket enough!
PupSocks,2020-12-30T12:37:37Z,5,"I am very happy with how the blankets turned out. I ordered one for my parents and one for my sister and bother-in-law. They absolutely love them. So soft, perfect size. Given the holiday season the delivery was delayed which was completely understandable. We are thankful!"
PupSocks,2020-12-30T12:29:02Z,5,Wife loves her new socks. Looks great
PupSocks,2020-12-30T11:47:12Z,1,"I ordered a pair of PupSocks (a product for which your company is literally named) on 12/1/20 for a friend's Christmas present. Mid-month, I received a pair of socks with images of random dogs. I immediately began communicating with the company via their online chat function and email. I've received only mass communications with excuses about a USPS delay, which does not explain why I would have received the wrong socks. I also received an unsigned email that was supposedly from the founder and CEO of the company to which I responded. Following that, I received an email from a staff person on 12/21/20 with a new order number, so supposedly I have the correct order on its way, which is scheduled to arrive at the beginning of January. We will see.Another communication of note is a 40% off a new order to make up for the delays. Seriously? Even if I do receive the correct item, I will never order from this company again. Bad service is obviously baked into the company if there is entire Facebook page dedicated to unhappy customers trying to figure out if they've been scammed."
PupSocks,2020-12-30T08:56:12Z,5,Christmas present for a 9 year old who absolutely loved the blanket with her two dogs all over it. THank you!
PupSocks,2020-12-30T07:44:20Z,5,I got a mask and socks done of our former (RIP) pet pigeon. Huge hit for our holiday work party. They were well done! Thanks!!
PupSocks,2020-12-30T07:09:00Z,4,"The shipping was the only bad part of this order. I got these as a Christmas present for my sister and she absolutely loves them. I ordered on Cyber Monday though and didn't receive them until a few days after Christmas. Wish they could have come a bit sooner, but I do understand the delays because of Covid and the overwhelming amount of packages for the postal service."
PupSocks,2020-12-30T06:31:54Z,5,These socks were a hit at my fiance's family's house. He loved them! They all loved them. They are perfect. To be honest I was worried that when you stretch the out the picture would look strange. But it doesn't they look awesome! Thank you so much! I will be purchasing again!
PupSocks,2020-12-30T06:14:29Z,5,"I ordered a face mask for my sister with a photo of her dog on it, she truly loved it. The photo came out great! I highly recommend and will definitely be ordering again from this site. Great quality work 👍🏼"
PupSocks,2020-12-30T06:14:10Z,2,I sent a picture that had 2 dogs and said use the white dog. The brown dog was used instead and turned out to be a bad gift. The 2nd star is because customer service replied quickly and said they would take care of it. Resolution pending
PupSocks,2020-12-30T06:09:50Z,1,I ordered my items on the 1st of the month and was told that my items would arrive 8-10 days later. They were suppose to be here before Christmas and it is now the 39th and still no word as to when I will receive my items. I had to go out and purchase new presents since I didn’t have anything to give. Beyond frustrated!
PupSocks,2020-12-30T05:56:55Z,3,Image on the socks turned out great! Only issue I had is that the socks aren’t really wearable “socks” in my opinion. They don’t have much of a heal at all and were extremely long to the point where they wouldn’t really be practical to wear.
PupSocks,2020-12-30T05:45:19Z,5,Received our puppy blanket- too cute and very soft.. will purchase again .. thanks for making such a cute blanket!
PupSocks,2020-12-30T05:31:21Z,1,Product did not arrive before Christmas after I ordered on black friday.
PupSocks,2020-12-30T05:11:32Z,2,I ordered 2 pairs of socks back in November to assure they would arrive in time for my children for Christmas and they did not arrive. Just came today and they are huge!! My daughter has pretty big feet for a 10 year old and the XS don’t come close to fitting her. The whole experience was disappointing to say the least. ☹️ The design was the only saving grace as my daughter can’t wait to “grow into them” and wear them.
PupSocks,2020-12-30T05:09:56Z,1,I placed my order Thanksgiving weekend and still haven’t received them.  When I reached out to Customer support I got a canned message.  My order said it has been shipped but from what I can tell it is still sitting at usps in GA.  I am considering fighting the charges soon.
PupSocks,2020-12-30T05:06:43Z,1,"I ordered on December 1st...  This company is horrible!!   The whole delivery in 5-8 days is a complete lie!!!   I have sent several messages, and they blame it all on covid!!!    It has now been 30 dats since my order and still nothing!!   I have asked for a refund, and have not heard back!!!   Pretty sure I have been scammed!!!!"
PupSocks,2020-12-30T05:04:51Z,1,"Took almost a month to receive. Sent an email to question the delay and received no response. Item was cute enough but overpriced, especially for the lack in customer service."
PupSocks,2020-12-30T04:42:44Z,5,I ordered 3 different pairs for my family members and they turned out great! They arrived today (later than expected but it didn't matter) and they were even better than I had imagined. The pictures were crystal clear and perfectly cropped and placed on the socks! They got some great laughter out of all of us. So good.
PupSocks,2020-12-30T04:33:02Z,1,"Never received my order and the tracking number is not working, very disappointed that you can’t tell me where my package is, it was a Christmas present! Your E mail address is not good either, I want someone to find my package"
PupSocks,2020-12-30T04:30:21Z,2,"My son loved the socks. I was a little less enthusiastic. Our pet looked brown rather than gray. I can see that it resulted from the sock color, but I think that could have been avoided. The fabric was not what I expected. Admittedly, I didn’t pay attention to that detail, but it looks like a compression sock my grandmother would wear. Great idea poorly executed."
PupSocks,2020-12-30T04:16:04Z,1,I ordered two different sets of socks to two different mailing addresses. The one set arrived. Fun gift but the socks are not all that. No worries. The other pair however never arrived. I’ve requested help for 10 days now. No response.
PupSocks,2020-12-30T04:03:35Z,3,"The color and detail of the pet’s picture on the socks were excellent.  Unfortunately the shape of the socks themselves weren’t.  They’re basically like a squared off tube sock, not shaped to fit the foot at all.  As a result they tend to bunch up around the toe and heel in a shoe, making them very uncomfortable.  Huge disappointment!"
PupSocks,2020-12-30T03:59:08Z,5,"Very pleased with my purchase. The blanket is beautiful and high quality. The picture turned out perfect! I was nervous it would look weird, but it looks JUST like the picture I submitted."
PupSocks,2020-12-30T03:55:48Z,4,"It is really good quality. Just maybe a bit pricey compared to other companies, and the time it came was a bit delayed but you expect that throughout christmas."
PupSocks,2020-12-30T03:40:13Z,1,Received wrong order and have not heard back from customer service yet
PupSocks,2020-12-30T03:39:34Z,5,"My husband & I a very happy with our dog masks, they are cute & have gotten compliments.  Thank you for a quality product."
PupSocks,2020-12-30T03:38:50Z,5,I purchased these socks for my husband - and he loves them! Our precious puppy has just a few months left with us and I got these for a precious memory.
PupSocks,2020-12-30T03:25:26Z,5,"My photo provided was of a puppy. I have gifted many Pupsocks the last few years but never such a small dog. Typically only the dog’s face is used. I requested in the comment box to utilize picture of entire dog. So happy when the socks arrived & entire dog was the image. The recipients are a family of 5, they love their socks! Thank you Pupsocks for honoring my request."
PupSocks,2020-12-30T03:24:39Z,4,"The socks are great and the quality of the images are very good. I am giving it a four stars review because I received the wrong order the first time. The issue was fixed, however I wasn’t able to gift the sock the day I planned to."
PupSocks,2020-12-30T03:20:27Z,5,Order was made in a timely fashion. Very happy with how my pets look on the socks!
PupSocks,2020-12-30T03:08:51Z,5,"The socks were a gift for my grown daughter. She acquired a Covid puppy for her kids, but is madly in love with her. She was delighted to see Millie’s picture in her socks."
PupSocks,2020-12-30T03:08:06Z,3,The item was beautiful! My boyfriend loves the blanket. I decided to use a picture of the family dog  that passed away 2 years ago. Unfortunately the only downside is the shipping it took longer than usually. I wanted him to get it for Christmas but it came 5 days afterwards. Very sad. Overall the blanket was amazing!!!’
PupSocks,2020-12-30T02:58:06Z,1,Horrible product and horrible service. Ordered them 25 days before I wanted when they said it would take 5-7 days. Emailed about 15 times to change order or cancel in the first few days. They respond 20 days after saying they’ll give refund or can change order and I respond immediately multiple times and they never respond. The product comes finally when I didn’t want it anymore and didn’t get the changes and they’re trash. Doesn’t fit at all. Says woman’s S fits size 4-8. I’m a size 6 and  theyre way too big and don’t shrink. This company is a joke. Don’t use them
PupSocks,2020-12-30T02:40:20Z,1,"Material isn’t soft, pictures were cropped weirdly, took a long time. I do not recommend getting these socks"
PupSocks,2020-12-30T02:38:42Z,5,The PupSocks were a great hit. Love them.
PupSocks,2020-12-30T02:27:31Z,5,LOVE!  I had added a special request for the 2 pair of socks I ordered as gifts. The instructions were not only read but followed!  They were received after Christmas but that didn't matter because my niece and her boyfriend LOVED them!!!  Great looking socks & great quality! Highly recommend!
PupSocks,2020-12-30T02:22:03Z,1,"This review has nothing to do with the product, as I have not received it yet. We are approaching one month since my order was placed and it is still listed as IN PRODUCTION. I have had limited communication with the GPS team and would be happy to update and post a review when i receive the product but i can't yet."
PupSocks,2020-12-30T02:16:37Z,5,loved them! fit awesome and looked amazing
PupSocks,2020-12-30T02:15:16Z,2,We received the wrong socks. We ordered docks with our two dogs on them and instead we got a pair with a cat. When I emailed I got a auto generated message asking for patience and blaming it on the post office.
PupSocks,2020-12-30T02:14:26Z,1,Ordered December 1s as a gift.  The site said the item would arrive before Christmas.   After 3 weeks of processing it was finally shipped and wasn't received until December 26th.
PupSocks,2020-12-30T02:11:40Z,1,"I received my order.  It was incorrect.  I emailed the company on multiple occasions.  Did not receive a reply or the correct product.  At this point, they are stealing my money and I'm filing complaint with credit card company."
PupSocks,2020-12-30T02:08:00Z,1,it has not been delivered!
PupSocks,2020-12-30T02:05:03Z,5,Got our three furballs on a mask and some socks and couldn’t be happier. A friend shared a picture of them a few weeks ago and I knew EXACTLY what my significant other was getting for the holidays and it definitely didn’t disappoint. Material for both are awesome and doesn’t stretch the faces like most printed wear does. Would definitely recommend to friends and family.
PupSocks,2020-12-30T02:03:01Z,5,Great socks & a wonderful gift. Very comfortable.
PupSocks,2020-12-30T02:02:29Z,5,I got 2 matching blankets for my sisters and they love them!!! The perfect Christmas gift
PupSocks,2020-12-30T01:55:36Z,4,I’ve purchased two pair of pup socks for my adult son. The first pair were perfect but I regret the picture I chose for the second pair. But my son likes them. I will probably order another pair.
PupSocks,2020-12-30T01:51:45Z,5,Our order is perfect!
PupSocks,2020-12-30T01:35:25Z,1,"I ordered my socks on Nov 30 and they still have not arrived. Since then I have got promotions from pupsocks around the 20th about placing orders and getting them in time for new years and this was in poor taste.I cant comment yet on the quality of the socks, but so far with the delivery I was to able to give them to the people I care about on xmas."
PupSocks,2020-12-30T01:25:03Z,1,My order was very late ordered on the 1st got them on the 29th.
PupSocks,2020-12-30T01:22:53Z,3,I placed an order on November 30th and still haven’t received it. ☹️ I have emailed a few times but haven’t received any responses.
PupSocks,2020-12-30T01:22:43Z,5,We have a young rescue dog and an 11 year old grandson who love each other. For Christmas we gave our grandson a pair of socks with her picture. The look on his face was priceless when he realized it was her!
PupSocks,2020-12-30T01:10:37Z,1,"Loved the picture on the socks, but very big in size. And the top of socks feel like they are pulling when on your feet. A little disappointed."
PupSocks,2020-12-30T01:08:48Z,4,"Love them! Only criticism is they seem a little tight on the calf area straight from packaging. Hoping they will loosen up, as all socks do, with a little wear."
PupSocks,2020-12-30T01:02:32Z,1,"Ordered November 27, 2020. Still have not received my order. I can see why this company has been reported to the better business bureau."
PupSocks,2020-12-30T01:01:01Z,2,"I bought a blanket with three animal photos. The quality of the photos was medium, with one great, one okay and one poor. Would have appreciated feedback before printing, especially as it took three weeks for the order to arrive. The quality of blanket was also very poor considering the price I paid."
PupSocks,2020-12-30T00:45:33Z,4,"Cute socks, but expensive"
PupSocks,2020-12-30T00:43:49Z,1,"I STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED MY ORDER!!!!!IF I COULD GIVE ZERO STARS, I WOULD!!"
PupSocks,2020-12-30T00:43:49Z,1,Placed my order end of November but never received it. Emailed the company on three separate occasions over a period of three weeks only to receive a generic email with a promise that someone would follow up which never happened.I would not recommend this company as the customer service is non existent. They do not stand behind their products. I will file a claim with my credit card company for reimbursement of my purchase.
PupSocks,2020-12-30T00:38:39Z,1,I ordered 2 pairs of socks on December 5th. I still have not received them. All I got was an email saying they were on the way on the 21st.
PupSocks,2020-12-30T00:28:35Z,3,"Shipping took a bit, but that was expected with the holiday rush and covid. So, no complaints there. The photo of my cat looks good on the socks, except that Pupsocks made my white cat, brown."
PupSocks,2020-12-30T00:23:12Z,5,"Bought as a Christmas present, impressed to say the least! Was afraid of the pictures turning out ""cheesy"" or cartoonish but they were perfect! Looked exactly like our pup! Fit to size aswell!"
PupSocks,2020-12-30T00:18:04Z,4,Pup photos turned out great but quality of sock was just average.  The socks are definitely more of a show-and-tell type of gift rather than a typical comfortable sock gift.  It melted hearts but wish they were more comfortable.
PupSocks,2020-12-30T00:17:57Z,1,"Very disappointed in the socks and the process.  I gave clear instructions about what I wanted for the dog and the cat photos I sent. Instead I got socks with a cat and a person!! No dog. Whoever processed the order just randomly selected a human head to add to the socks from the photo that contained the dog. And a different human was selected for each pair. I don’t know why anyone would do that.  They clearly read the instructions because they got the cat correct. If there was a problem with using the dog, they should have let me know. But they couldn’t be bothered. Instead they just did what they wanted. Further, they sent the mock up 3 days after I received the socks. The process is messed up. I’ve asked for my money back. Haven’t heard anything."
PupSocks,2020-12-30T00:15:27Z,5,This is the 2nd time I have ordered from PupSocks. They are so cute and the pictures of the animal is absolutely adorable.
PupSocks,2020-12-30T00:06:52Z,1,"Ordered a blanket and a pair of socks back on November 30. Still waiting for the items. My wife had no Christmas gift this year. Regards, Nelson Fernandes Order #2463312] (November 30, 2020)"
PupSocks,2020-12-30T00:06:22Z,5,I could not have been happier about how the socks for my wife’s Christmas present turned out. High quality and fun!!
PupSocks,2020-12-30T00:04:28Z,5,The socks and mask are adorable.  I was very lucky and got my order on Christmas Eve due to the USPS issues.  PupSocks was ready with some personal email cards that I could have sent if they hadn't come on time.  I can definitely see ordering more for other gifts this year.
PupSocks,2020-12-30T00:03:42Z,5,I ordered through this company because they donate to an animal shelter. I always look to purchase from companies whom give back.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T23:53:44Z,1,I placed an order on Nov 28th. Got an email saying a shipping label was created dec 8th. USPS is saying they are waiting for my item to arrive. I have sent several emails and got 1 generic blanket response. I was excited to find this company and wanted to place more orders. Needless to say I will never deal with them again.  Very poor service.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T23:52:24Z,5,I purchased two pair of socks for a Christmas gift and he absolutely loved them and I was very pleased on how they turned out! They were the best gift.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T23:46:56Z,1,I ordered over 100.00 of Christmas socks for my kids for Christmas and have yet to receive them.... sent three emails to customer service and only received 1 automated email saying they were very busy but that I would hear something back in72hrs or so.... no has gotten back to me.... my visa was charged but I don’t have the socks!Margaret
PupSocks,2020-12-29T23:41:56Z,5,They did a good job cropping the photo I sent and it looked great on the socks! Got exactly what I wanted.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T23:24:59Z,5,High quality color/graphic depiction of the cat pics I sent!  Our Cat mom loves them!
PupSocks,2020-12-29T23:23:49Z,1,"These were a colossal waste of money. They aren’t even socks. They're an overpriced, horrible tube of fabric that don’t form to your feet and hardly resemble a sock. Might as well hang them on the wall as they have a picture on them, because that’s all they’re good for."
PupSocks,2020-12-29T23:20:19Z,1,I ordered socks and mask on 1 Dec - have yet to receive. When I inquired I was told I’d get a response in72 hours - that did not happen. Still waiting to receive.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T23:15:06Z,4,"Loved the idea but not entirely sold on the actual socks themselves.The fabric feels like a compression sock with no actual ""heel""."
PupSocks,2020-12-29T23:09:31Z,4,Socks were definitely cute but the material was cheaply made and doesn’t really fit a foot well. But it did what I was looking for and got the cutest picture of our new pup on something the kids could wear.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T23:08:44Z,5,We lost our dog right before Christmas so my husband was beyond touched by this gift. I got him socks and a matching mask and he loves them both. Thank you.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T23:06:46Z,5,Cute socks! The printing was great!
PupSocks,2020-12-29T23:06:32Z,3,The idea is super cute and since my dog recently died I wanted something special for me and my kids to remember him by.  The reason for the 3 stars is that the socks weren't the most comfortable and the picture waa cropped poorly.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T23:05:45Z,5,"My best friend takes care of my cats when I travel, so I got him a blanket with all four of their faces. Here's what he said: ""It's like made out of the material. It's not a patch... it's really heavy and well made."" I'm so glad I ordered it! Maybe I'll get myself one."
PupSocks,2020-12-29T23:04:26Z,5,They are the cutest thing I have ever seen!  Any animal lover would love to have a pair!
PupSocks,2020-12-29T23:02:55Z,5,"Super nice socks and the image turned out quite well/of good quality, great!"
PupSocks,2020-12-29T22:55:05Z,5,I received the pink blanket with my pups face and loved it. I ordered one for my sis in law. The only problem was that the dogs pink tongue blended in with the blanket. I should have done a different color. Still adorable and a fabulous product.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T22:53:52Z,3,Meh. Made for a fun gift and the outlining of the cat faces was good but the material is super weird. NOT sick material and not comfy or cozy. They felt like plastic.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T22:52:23Z,1,Currently still do not have my “shipped” order. Looks like you need to hire a new shipping company-usps isn’t cutting it. Can’t review what I don’t have
PupSocks,2020-12-29T22:42:56Z,5,All 3 pairs I ordered are adorable and cherished Thank you
PupSocks,2020-12-29T22:42:10Z,5,I ordered a pair as a Christmas gift & I was so pleasantly surprised how cute they came out.  The gift was a HIT!
PupSocks,2020-12-29T22:41:22Z,1,Order did not arrive for Christmas even though it was weeks prior to the holidays.  Westill have not received the socks. Extremely disappointing and more disappointed that you continued to send marketing emails one week before Christmas encouraging problem to order and indicating to unsuspecting customers that the socks would arrive in time for Christmas even though I had already received a notification forYou that the socks would not arrive in time.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T22:37:36Z,1,Socks ok. Shipping sucks
PupSocks,2020-12-29T22:34:16Z,2,"Despite guarantees that it would be it on time, the order arrived 23 days after I placed it, missing Christmas entirely.  In addition, the socks were too big and the overall quality was lacking.  I've also been continually spammed by the company trying to get me to be a repeat customer.  I think I'm going to pass and would recommend that others pass as well."
PupSocks,2020-12-29T22:33:43Z,3,The socks themselves are adorable but they came in about a week later than expected and we missed our holiday. Also I ordered another 2 sets with a picture of our granddaughter but we got 2 sets with some dogs on them.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T22:29:03Z,4,"Loved everything about these except for the cuff, or should I say lack there of. Without a real cuff they looked sort of odd/cheap. But they were a gift and the recipient loved them so not a huge deal."
PupSocks,2020-12-29T22:28:56Z,1,I ordered this on Dec 1.  It is Dec 29 and I have not received my order.  I am absolutely not happy with my purchase.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T22:28:32Z,1,"Placed my order December 1st, for a Christmas present. Still have not received it.So I can’t review the product, only the service for the delayed delivery.."
PupSocks,2020-12-29T22:26:17Z,5,"Loved my Gracie socks.   Such a fun Christmas gift.  Thanks for prompt service, even during a pandemic!"
PupSocks,2020-12-29T22:22:54Z,5,Turned out good
PupSocks,2020-12-29T22:20:19Z,1,Ordered December 1 and still do not have item as of December 29. When I receive it I have to mail myself b/c my son left after Christmas. Have emailed. No response!
PupSocks,2020-12-29T22:19:28Z,3,Quality of fabric thin and pictures blurred. Cute though.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T22:15:24Z,1,Was promised delivery by Christmas when I ordered in November and it’s now 30th December and still no socks😡 by tracking they weren’t even sent out until 2 days before Christmas. Won’t be ordering again or recommending to anyone. Have been trying to contact someone for over a week and not one person could reply to an email or Facebook message. Horrible  service
PupSocks,2020-12-29T22:15:10Z,1,Took an extremely EXTREMELY long time to arrive even considering Covid delays. Quality sub par. Lacking customer service. It’d be faster to photoshop your own picture and order from a custom clothes site.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T22:09:27Z,3,"Mock up was different than what I received, but product is overall nice quality. Ordered as a gift for Christmas and it did not arrive in time even after company promised as such. I realize under normal circumstances it may have arrived in time, but they too should have known circumstances are not normal during a pandemic and should not make delivery promises they cannot keep."
PupSocks,2020-12-29T22:08:34Z,1,"Ordered on 11/30.  Shipped on 12/19.  Still have not received as of 12/29. Was not exactly happy about the 20-day production turnaround. I get that it's the holidays but still seems excessive.  I also realize that shipping delays are not your fault but if it could have been sent earlier.I also sent an email to customer service but no one ever responded. They offered printable handouts in place of the socks until theys are received but two socks on my order were completely left out. In any case, I will update my review if I ever get them and evaluate the quality.   Sorry to be a bummer but I'm pretty bummed that none of the gifts were given on Christmas."
PupSocks,2020-12-29T22:07:56Z,5,The socks look perfect! My mom will love this super fun gift featuring her granddogs.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T21:57:33Z,5,"The blanket is really nice!  I wish we could ""preview"" what it will look like before it is made though.  I had 3 photos on mine and after seeing the blanket would have preferred not to have one on it.  But it still is a great quality and beautiful.  I would order another again!"
PupSocks,2020-12-29T21:56:27Z,2,I have yet to receive my ordered that was supposedly delivered on Dec.14I am still waiting for my order
PupSocks,2020-12-29T21:53:08Z,5,Cute socks. Fun gift.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T21:44:10Z,1,"I’d give this company a 0 if I could! I usually don’t review, unless I really like the item I ordered or the service. I give credit, where credit is due! However, I had to review how bad of an experience I had with this company! I ordered my socks at the end of November and I received them later than expected to then receive the wrong socks. I emailed pupsocks multiple times to let them know if the mistake and didn’t get a response until a week or so later. They responded telling me they would send a replacement at no cost. Why would I pay anything after a mistake on their end? Ridiculous! They also said, they would send an email with shipping information with tracking information and if I didn’t receive anything within a few days, to email them letting them know. In which, I did! In addition, I told them just to give me a refund, since I specifically said I needed the socks before the 22nd of December. Weeks past and still no email. Until I get an email stating my socks have shipped. What! What about the refund I asked for? I really wanted to like pupsocks because from what is advertised on their website, they are supporters of the Humane Society. Yet, I still haven’t received my socks or a refund (how I had asked). I ended up having to buy another pair of socks from a seller on Etsy. They were great, got my socks less than a week I had purchased them. Would not be buying from pupsocks again because of the lack of communication!"
PupSocks,2020-12-29T21:39:37Z,5,The socks turned out great!! We can’t wait to order a blanket.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T21:38:57Z,4,"The ordering process was easy and the product was fantastic. Did not give 5 stars because the customer service response was awful.  No response to my 1st inquiry and multiple days went by before a response came from my 2nd inquiry. Also the item did not leave the factory within the time frame indicated on the website. Therefore due to that as well as shipping delays which is not the fault of the seller, the item was not received in time for Christmas but was ordered well in advance with what should have been plenty of time to receive it."
PupSocks,2020-12-29T21:32:19Z,1,"Not sure why I've been asked to write a review considering I still haven't received my socks and it's been a full month since placing my order. I understand that companies get backed up, but please don't advertise the socks being shipped within 3-5 business days if that's simply not possible. There are plenty of other companies that make this product and I absolutely would have gone a different direction had I known it was going to take this long."
PupSocks,2020-12-29T21:29:53Z,1,We were really disappointed by the quality of the socks. They were very uncomfortable and the fabric is very scratchy. We have ordered custom socks from other companies and had much better experiences. I would not order from Pupsocks again.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T21:29:46Z,5,My girlfriend and our dog both love the blanket with the pup's face on it. It's so fuzzy they have been cuddling with it nearly non stop since Christmas. The crop of our dog's face is perfect and adorable. Thanks!
PupSocks,2020-12-29T21:26:24Z,1,"I place an order for Christmas gifts on 12/1 and was given an 8-12 day shipping time. They did not arrive until the 28th. After Christmas.  Sure blame it on covid, but we've all been dealing with it since March, so it should not have come as a surprise to Pupsocks. Also, the fit of the socks is baggy and not stretchy so they do not conform to the foot. Cute designs, but not functional."
PupSocks,2020-12-29T21:25:32Z,1,"I placed an order, received the order but it was not the correct socks. I received someone else’s socks with a cat on them when I ordered my puppy face. I emailed the company three times. I have yet to hear a response and it’s been about 2 1/2 weeks and I still don’t have my socks. I totally understand that it’s the holidays but the customer service is very poor. And they’re asking me to still review sucks that I never received"
PupSocks,2020-12-29T21:25:27Z,5,I've bought three things from ads on Instagram and this is the only item that was as advertised. The three pairs I bought for Christmas presents were awesome! Communication and shipping were great. I'll be buying more in the future.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T21:23:53Z,5,They looked great and arrived on time!  My daughter loves that she can take her puppy back to school with her.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T21:23:53Z,5,The editing was amazing and they shipped quickly! Very happy with my purchase.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T21:22:11Z,5,"These socks turned out absolutely adorable! Nice quality, my daughter loved them! The biggest bummer though, was that I bought them as a Christmas gift and the packaging they came in made it VERY obvious what was inside. Since my daughter checks the mail, it totally ruined the surprise."
PupSocks,2020-12-29T21:16:07Z,3,my daughter loved seeing her dogs on socks but they don't fit her feet at all so not sure what we will do with them. Expensive one-day thrill.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T21:14:48Z,4,I got socks for my son and they came out great. No problems with ordering or shipping. They came after Christmas but overall processing and shipping time was fine. I didn’t order until second week of December and they arrived 12/29.  I didn’t expect they would make it before Christmas so no problems!! My son loves them!
PupSocks,2020-12-29T21:06:00Z,1,I ordered in November 30th and still have not received my shipment but they took my money. No updates. Nothing. Just a scam
PupSocks,2020-12-29T21:02:55Z,5,The kitten socks I had made came out perfectly.  It was a fun gift for the holidays!  Great work.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T21:00:58Z,5,Great quality and festive gift!
PupSocks,2020-12-29T20:57:27Z,2,"Socks are cute, really amazing pic of our chihuahua /Pug. However the fit of the socks is atrocious. It’s basically a tube with no contour whatsoever. So they’re really baggy at the heel and ankle. They’re worthless for anything but walking around the house."
PupSocks,2020-12-29T20:57:22Z,5,Got a mask for my daughter and socks for my son of our new puppy.  Their reactions were priceless on Christmas morning!  They loved the new gear!  Seem like very nice quality not just a novelty.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T20:50:31Z,2,"I bought 3 pairs of socks for Christmas. 1 for each kid 11,9,7 years old. The custom photos and color of the socks were great! The problem is the actual cut of the sock, they are more like a tube sock and way to wide at the toes. So despite being cute the kids won’t wear them due to the fit. Honestly, I don’t blame them because I tried them on and they were not comfortable at all."
PupSocks,2020-12-29T20:45:44Z,1,"I received someone else's order.  The order took a great deal of time to reach me in the 1st place, which I understand due to the many challenges currently with Covid.  But even when the order came, it was incorrect.  I have reached out 2x's to get resolution and have still not received my actual order or a refund."
PupSocks,2020-12-29T20:45:27Z,5,"Looked great, just like the picture I sent in, family loved them."
PupSocks,2020-12-29T20:43:55Z,1,"After waiting nearly a month for delivery — missing the holidays for which they were intended as a gift for my kids — I was extremely disappointed in the quality of what finally arrived. The socks are unfinished the top and appear to have been pressed within an inch of their lives. The material seems very cheap, and pulls easily.  They wouldn’t be worth the price if they cost half as much. Beyond that, I ordered size “XS” for two boys, aged 4 and six. The socks are huge — far too large for either one to wear. This purchase was a complete waste of both my time and my money."
PupSocks,2020-12-29T20:34:49Z,5,"Super cute product! I ordered my husband some socks for Christmas with our dog’s face on them. I was pleased with the shipping, ease of tracking package, and quality of product. I would recommend this to friends and family."
PupSocks,2020-12-29T20:34:20Z,5,"Last year, I ordered Christmas socks with our pup's face on them for my hubs and son, and they were adorable! This year, I ordered a face mask for my nephew with his pug's mug and it was the hit of the Christmas stocking exchange! Everything I've gotten here is high quality and comes out just the way I expected and hoped."
PupSocks,2020-12-29T20:34:11Z,5,"I purchased pup socks Christmas 2019 and again this Christmas 2020. The socks were better than I pictured. With slower shipping issues this 2020 did not think I would get in time for Christmas, but 6 pm Christmas Eve they were delivered. Awesome!"
PupSocks,2020-12-29T20:32:23Z,1,I haven’t received the product yet ordered on December 1st
PupSocks,2020-12-29T20:29:48Z,1,Still have not received my order so completing a review would be futile.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T20:22:29Z,3,The product was good but USPS was terrible.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T20:18:18Z,1,I place an order with PupSocks on Nov. 23. Today is Dec. 29. The order still hasn't arrived. Not only it did not come for Christmas as it was supposed to but it looks like it will arrive next year!!!! Stay away from this company.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T20:16:26Z,5,Awesome!! We are so happy with our pup socks. The designer did a perfect job and the socks are so cute. We are delighted! Thank you!
PupSocks,2020-12-29T20:14:10Z,5,ABsolutely the perfect gift!
PupSocks,2020-12-29T20:12:24Z,1,Took forever to get my order...received some of my order and also a pair of socks I didn’t order. I am still missing a pair of socks I ordered and have YET to hear back from anyone about this. I messaged on the 19th and still NO word from anyone.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T20:10:21Z,5,"Loved it, was a great Christmas gift!"
PupSocks,2020-12-29T20:09:26Z,5,I gave three pairs of Pup Socks to the pet owners/lovers in my family for Christmas.  They were delighted with the clarity of each pet’s picture and with their chosen sock color! These gifts were immediate Instagram and FB post! Thanks for your VERY quick service and great quality of these special presents!
PupSocks,2020-12-29T19:58:04Z,5,The socks were a big hit with the family - thank you.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T19:58:01Z,5,"Great product, exactly what was described.   Customer service was great.   I ordered for Christmas presents, have now ordered birthday presents."
PupSocks,2020-12-29T19:57:20Z,1,"Considering I ordered this product a month ago as a Christmas gift and I STILL haven’t received it, I’m very disappointed in this product, that I have never even laid eyes on. Also, the fact that a survey went out before the product did makes me even more angry about not receiving it as of yet. Pitiful."
PupSocks,2020-12-29T19:51:32Z,5,"My son LOVES his socks, which were a surprise for his Christmas stocking! Now my other son is jealous and wants a pair as well! 😁"
PupSocks,2020-12-29T19:50:40Z,1,"I have not received my package or even know where it is! No customer service! No one to contact and I have to pay a return fee if I cancel my order which for some reason, I am unable to do. I ordered a month ago. It was advertised 8-10 days to receive within USA. I will never order from this company again. I wouldn't feel so upset if I had some communication other than the ""be patient"" automated response you get when you track a package. This was a great concept but lack of professionalism and communication destroyed this company."
PupSocks,2020-12-29T19:46:49Z,5,Ordered the blanket for a friend.  It was PERFECT—had her two cats on it and the blanket is so soft and warm!  Perfect for cuddling!
PupSocks,2020-12-29T19:43:53Z,2,My son said the inside of the socks were very uncomfortable and scratchy.  We liked the way they looked but let’s be honest no one wears uncomfortable socks.   That’s very disappointing after paying over $20 for them and waiting a month for them to be delivered.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T19:40:51Z,5,We are happy with how our blanket and socks turned out!
PupSocks,2020-12-29T19:36:55Z,5,Great quality socks! I gave it as a gift and the recipients loved them!
PupSocks,2020-12-29T19:36:49Z,2,"My dog's image was cropped so that he looked deformed, and I was not given an opportunity to approve it prior to printing. The fabric of the socks is also not very nice to the touch, very artificial feeling."
PupSocks,2020-12-29T19:35:33Z,5,Love the socks! Great job putting the picture on!
PupSocks,2020-12-29T19:35:09Z,1,Will not ever use this company again. I ordered about a month before Christmas. I have been tracking the item and never received it. I cannot get a response and I have no choice but to file a dispute with my credit card company.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T19:34:59Z,5,Perfect. Looks just like picture. Couldn’t have done any better!
PupSocks,2020-12-29T19:29:04Z,1,I still haven’t received my order so I cannot give a review other than it’s been a month since I ordered.... I know it’s COVID and Christmas...but still.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T19:27:38Z,1,The picture on the socks was good but the picture of the dog on the blanket was unrecognizable. The same photo was used for both so I’m not sure why that happened.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T19:25:10Z,2,"I was very excited to purchase these socks although quite pricey. I ordered in November and my order was sent to shipping on 11/18. After a few days of checking the status,  the status never changed. I reached out to customer service and they verified the order was lost. They put in another order for me but due to the timing it got caught up in the Holiday rush. I expected them to overnite the items since the first order was lost but it was submitted through USPS and didn't get shipped out till 12/18. It's only a 4 hour drive from Atlanta to Charlotte but I just got notification that my order was just delivered today the 29th well after when I needed it by. I am very disappointed to say the least. I'm in Florida where I celebrated Christmas but my items are in Charlotte and I won't be back to Florida for another month."
PupSocks,2020-12-29T19:24:46Z,1,Package arrived with no product in it :(
PupSocks,2020-12-29T19:23:26Z,5,"Cute, unique products! The quality is good and the pictures are clear (not pixelated or blurry)."
PupSocks,2020-12-29T19:17:18Z,2,It arrived very late and the material of the sock is weird. It’s not your standard sock. Picture is cute but definitely not worth the price.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T19:16:43Z,5,"During 2020, our pets kept us positive with their unconditional love. Giving pup socks, and a pup blanket, to four loved ones was special. It was fun to watch them be opened on Christmas morning."
PupSocks,2020-12-29T19:15:39Z,5,I highly recommend these socks! Got them for my wife as a stocking stuffer for Christmas and she loved them.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T19:13:42Z,5,"Super cute, bought 3 pairs as stocking stuffers for my sons + husband. Delivery was long, but I got a quick response to my email and the socks arrived before Xmas! All good!"
PupSocks,2020-12-29T19:13:12Z,1,"Our order did not arrive before Christmas. I made my order on December 1st. On the website, it says I will receive our order within 8-10 business days. 29 days later I have not received our items. Also, there isn’t a phone number to call someone for customer service. You can only email and hope you get a reply within “72” hours. Will not order from this site again. A let down for Christmas."
PupSocks,2020-12-29T19:12:27Z,5,Great fun- socks were well made and pets image very clear. Would recommend for any animal lover.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T19:11:36Z,1,"I am incredibly disappointed in this company.  I ordered 3 pairs of custom socks on December 1st and I still do not have them on December 29th.  I got added to the marketing emails so it was extra frustrating to see emails on December 14th saying you could still order in time for Christmas but my order was still 'in production'.  I reached out to customer service twice - once through email and once through the web site and never heard a peep.  I got an automated email saying my order shipped on 12/18 but that it could take 5 days for USPS to scan the package due to the holidays. USPS just marked it as 'Arrived' at their Atlanta facility yesterday, 12/28. It honestly makes me doubt that they got the package to USPS on the 18th. I was very much looking forward to these Christmas gifts but now we will be lucky to get them before the end of the year.Pup Socks did not meet their production timelines, set proper delivery expectations or respond to concerns about my order.  Let's hope they are actually good quality and turn out nice after all the wait and missing the chance to put them under the tree."
PupSocks,2020-12-29T19:10:20Z,5,LOVE THEM!! These were a Christmas gift and the receiver absolutely LOVED THEM!!  You captured our pets faces beautifully!
PupSocks,2020-12-29T19:08:20Z,1,Ordered Nov 28 never received the order. I sent multiple emails and no response
PupSocks,2020-12-29T19:06:19Z,5,"I have ordered Socks, Blankets and now a mask from Pup Socks.  Always been good quality.  The only issue with my last order has been that I have not received it yet and it was ordered on December 1st.  I realize that COVID has slowed down the USPS, but it's getting frustrating.  Maybe UPS is a better option."
PupSocks,2020-12-29T19:05:31Z,5,"We LOVED the socks with our cat, Eddy’s picture!!! I ordered a pair for my husband because they are the *best* of friends (insert major sarcasm here!) and they were the perfect gift! I also ordered a different pair for our granddaughter because they truly are the best of friends; she loves them!!!Thank you for the great gift idea and wonderful service!"
PupSocks,2020-12-29T19:03:59Z,2,"The quality of the product was fine. However the delay in my order was unforgivable. I ordered my items on December 1st and did not receive them until December 29th. My order was placed well in advance of the cut off for Christmas delivery, however between the delayed processing time and the mail mishaps this year my gifts were late. While I understand the issues surrounding the mail are not those of pupsocks it is still unfortunate and ultimately not the consumers problem. I will not be purchasing from this site again. I am aware of other sites that were able to provide products in a timely manner despite the issues with the postal Service."
PupSocks,2020-12-29T19:01:48Z,1,Did not receive item
PupSocks,2020-12-29T18:59:39Z,1,"I have placed 3 separate orders with multiple products in each order and haven't received any of my orders. The tracking #'s don't work and have a ""status"" and when I've emailed the company, no one has responded. Plus, the oders never arrived before Christmas when they were ordered well in advance. At this point, I'm not thrilled with PupSocks!"
PupSocks,2020-12-29T18:59:07Z,2,"The quality of these socks is not great. Infact, I'm more than a little embarrassed to present these as a gift. The photos are great on the socks, but the socks are not a good quality."
PupSocks,2020-12-29T18:58:45Z,1,Ordered on December 1st. They were shipped on December 19th. We still have Not received them as off December 29th.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T18:55:42Z,5,I ordered a blanket with my pups faces on it and it turned out so adorable!!! The blanket is so soft and comfy too.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T18:55:30Z,5,"I bought these socks for my brother and sister in law for Christmas with their two dogs faces on them.  They absolutely love them.  My SIL posted a picture on facebook with the caption, “How to win Christmas, put my dogs faces on my socks!”"
PupSocks,2020-12-29T18:55:19Z,1,Over a month and still no socks received! Ordered in November and never made it for Christmas. I've lost faith that I will ever receive them.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T18:53:50Z,5,Turned out great!
PupSocks,2020-12-29T18:53:15Z,1,I ordered a pair of socks customized with a dog on them on December 1st. I did not receive my order until December 20th in which I received a pair of socks with a cat I did not order. I emailed customer service on 12/27 with no answer. I want my money back. This is unacceptable
PupSocks,2020-12-29T18:51:51Z,1,"I ordered my facemask on November 30, 2020.  It ""shipped"" the Monday before Christmas, and I still have not received it to date (12.29.2020).  Very, very, slow service."
PupSocks,2020-12-29T18:50:15Z,3,Graphics were spot on but sock quality was disappointment. Compression type sock was smaller in size than chart indicated. Could not get on foot so wasted gift.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T18:49:00Z,1,Ordered the end of Nov. still not received. You failed this time. I’ll go elsewhere next time.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T18:47:30Z,1,"Honestly the worst customer service I’ve ever experienced with ordering online, and considering I got the “rate how we did” email before my order even arrived shows how out-of-touch they are with how things are going. I understand with the holidays delays can happen, especially this year sure, but to keep your customers in the dark and when you finally reach out to them to give them the same bland info that you put out publicly shows how much customer issues matter to them. I won’t be buying from them anymore, for the headaches alone."
PupSocks,2020-12-29T18:45:13Z,5,"Great quality! So cute, and exactly what I had imagined!"
PupSocks,2020-12-29T18:40:33Z,3,"The design is clean and looked exactly like my dog. The feel of the socks are also very nice considering the way it is printed. My only (but main) issue is that apparently this compacy doesn't know what feet look like or how they are shaped. And for a company with SOCKS in their name, they are basically unwearable. OK for a funny gift, but that's abou tit."
PupSocks,2020-12-29T18:39:57Z,1,"Terrible customer service, no response and major delays for my order. It was in production for 25 days. Check their BBB profile! Wish I would have first. Any company that gives refunds this easily, does it for a reason."
PupSocks,2020-12-29T18:39:48Z,4,It's a great idea and made a perfect gift for someone who is hard to buy for.  The pictures of my cat came out nicely on the socks and mask.  The mask does not cover the face the way other masks do; comes up a bit on the small side.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T18:39:00Z,5,Great product and graphic was exactly what I sent as picture.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T18:37:36Z,5,The mask with our pups face on it was a Christmas gift for my wife and she really loved it.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T18:35:54Z,2,"I ordered these socks 4 weeks ago for a holiday gift and they still have not shown up. I understand that shipping has been delayed due to Covid, but just disappointed that after this much time, it has not been worked out. I appreciate the company sending a photo of what they will look like, so I can show that to the recipient, and they are reaching out and trying to be honest about the issues with keeping up with a huge number of orders, but wish there had been more clarity from the beginning that it might take this long, as I would have chosen something else."
PupSocks,2020-12-29T18:32:01Z,5,"I ordered a blanket for a friend for Christmas, now although the shipping took a ridiculous amount of time (about a month) it did arrive just before Christmas! and was it ever a gorgeous blanket! Would 100% order from them again. Just ensure you have PLENTY of time before you actually need the gift."
PupSocks,2020-12-29T18:31:39Z,1,"Ordered weeks ago as a Xmas present for my son, still have not received them. There is no phone number to call, and the email only gives auto response. Just looked them up on Facebook to see many other customers are in the same boat, and that there is an alert on the BBB website bc their customer service is so poor. Wish I knew that beforehand."
PupSocks,2020-12-29T18:31:33Z,3,So far I am not thrilled. I ordered on December 1st. I received notice that a shipping label was created on December 17th and it has just sat there since then. Yes I appreciate the mock-up pictures that you sent me of the three items that I ordered but I'm still not happy that it hasn't shipped yet
PupSocks,2020-12-29T18:30:02Z,5,I have ordered several times from pupsocks abs each order has been fabulous!  I am sure I will order from them again.  The blankets are awesome as well as the socks.  A real treat!
PupSocks,2020-12-29T18:27:31Z,5,The socks of my pup came out great. They cropped the photo really well. Got a pair for my whole family for Christmas.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T18:26:51Z,1,"You’re asking for a review and one month after my order, I have no order or an update on my order. That is my review"
PupSocks,2020-12-29T18:23:29Z,3,"Product was okay. Shipping was extremely delayed. In fact, one of my orders made on 12/1/2020 still hasn't been received as of 12/29/2020."
PupSocks,2020-12-29T18:22:48Z,2,"Ordered socks in November, recieved them after Christmas. When I realized they wouldn't be here in time for gift exchange, I requested to cancel my order and get a refund. Customer service did not acknowledge my request at all in their response. I repeated my request. I got zero response. I tried calling and emailed again and got nothing. The company seems like they're in over their heads and should limit sales to uphold their shipping promises. I won't order again and will definitely discourage anyone and everyone from ordering from PupSocks. The product is mediocre and the customer service is nonexistent."
PupSocks,2020-12-29T18:18:55Z,1,I ordered two pairs of socks and a blanket in November.  It is almost New Years and I still don’t have my items and the tracking says they are still in production.  These gifts did not make it for Christmas and I have no idea when they will even ship.  Don’t take the orders if you can’t deliver the items.  Very unhappy customer.Denise Herkimer
PupSocks,2020-12-29T18:18:12Z,2,"I left a request in the notes section but the socks didn’t come the way I wanted them to, and nobody reached out to acknowledge my request or let me know that they couldn’t fulfill it."
PupSocks,2020-12-29T18:16:29Z,5,Sister and girlfriend absolutely loved the gifts. I almost kept the blanket for myself 🤣
PupSocks,2020-12-29T18:10:55Z,1,"It has now been one month and I have yet to receive my order! I cannot review the product, because I haven’t seen it!"
PupSocks,2020-12-29T18:09:59Z,5,"Item came as described, looking good and on time."
PupSocks,2020-12-29T18:09:53Z,1,"I received another pet instead of mine on the item I ordered, and I have not received any emails back in the last month after multiple attempts at various emails I have found for this business. DO NOT  RECOMMEND"
PupSocks,2020-12-29T18:07:27Z,5,Purchased a few pairs of socks as gifts.  I received my order quickly. They looked great and everyone loved them.  Thanks!
PupSocks,2020-12-29T18:07:24Z,5,Not only did my son love his puppies new blanket the puppy sleeps with it every night.. a total Christmas hit!
PupSocks,2020-12-29T18:07:19Z,5,The socks were a big hit as a Christmas gift!
PupSocks,2020-12-29T18:06:12Z,5,Great quality! The pictures were exactly what I sent
PupSocks,2020-12-29T18:06:07Z,5,"This is our second pair of PupSocks and definitely not our last! Great quality, comfy, and fun to wear!"
PupSocks,2020-12-29T18:06:06Z,5,The pup blanket was a perfect surprise present for Christmas.  The blanket was super soft and comfy!
PupSocks,2020-12-29T18:03:25Z,5,Blanket is so cute and fluffy!
PupSocks,2020-12-29T18:03:23Z,1,No customer service. Not accurate timelines. Blame usps for delays but they delivered 3 days within receipt. Will never buy from again and will let others know to avoid and shop with sockery in future. Lot of Facebook ads to get one and done buyers I’m sure. Ruined my Christmas as well as many others. Never wish a business to not do well but I hope this one does not do well so others are not let down as I was.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T18:02:39Z,5,My son absolutely loved the pupsocks!! Was a big hit.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T18:02:33Z,5,I ordered 2 pairs one with my dog’s face for my son and one with my cat’s face for my daughter.  They both loved them!  It was probably the most talked about gift they received.  The order took a long time to come in but made it to us on Christmas Eve which was the perfect stocking stuffer.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T18:01:55Z,1,Just ok. These things are pretty expensive. Turned out pretty dark and couldn’t really tell it was that particular cat. Terrible communication/Customer service. All they did is kept sending back a email from the CEO saying they were busy. They never got back to me. I’d look somewhere else
PupSocks,2020-12-29T18:01:40Z,1,"Order came ripped and was the wrong type of blanket. Also ordered the gift wrapping option because it was a christmas gift, i was charged for it and it never was delivered or packaged with the blanket"
PupSocks,2020-12-29T18:01:31Z,1,I still have not received my order
PupSocks,2020-12-29T18:00:38Z,5,"Great socks, soooo cute!!"
PupSocks,2020-12-29T18:00:13Z,3,"The images were great and the material the socks were made out of were nice.  The fit of the sock was not very acceptable, my wife has a size 6.5 foot and these just seemed so far off that they looked like they should fit over a clowns boot."
PupSocks,2020-12-29T17:59:54Z,1,"This was the worse experience I had as far as ordering for Christmas. I ordered December 1. There was no further information besides my payment until the 12th. Where my order sat in pre shipment until the 27th. There was no communication from the company other then 2 generic emails. Even though I attempted multiple ways to contact. The blanket I requested on the picture “please crop in her neck” of my daughters deceased cat. The picture crop turned out to be just a rounded image, not even getting her full face and dark, hard to see the details of her. I didn’t like the color options so I choose white. The background on the blanket has dog bones on it for some reason. (It was for a Cat) the only positive I have is it is a soft blanket. Do Not waste your time or money on this company. After ordering I learned the company had an F rating from a BBB link someone posted on their page. For the almost $80 on this blanket, EVERYTHING should have been better."
PupSocks,2020-12-29T17:59:15Z,5,"Excellent quality socks! Very comfortable and the graphics are perfect! Customer service is second to none. Couldn't be happier, will purchase from again."
PupSocks,2020-12-29T17:58:32Z,1,"I still haven't received my order which was a Christmas gift, and I ordered it Nov 30!!"
PupSocks,2020-12-29T17:58:24Z,5,"Ordered each of my girls a pair with their cats on them, huge hit, tears were shed.Thanks for a great Christmas gift."
PupSocks,2020-12-29T17:57:47Z,5,I received a pair for a gift and loved them so much I gave them to two other family members!
PupSocks,2020-12-29T17:57:19Z,5,The pup socks came out better than I imagined. The dog’s faces looked perfect and the socks are so cute!
PupSocks,2020-12-29T17:56:53Z,5,They look great!
PupSocks,2020-12-29T17:56:44Z,1,"I never received my socks. I sent an email asking what happened and didn't hear back for over a week. They let me know they'd been lost during delivery and told me if I wanted my money back I wouldn't receive the full refund as the delivery charge would be kept back. Even though I didn't lose the socks! So I asked for a new pair to be shippped out instead, and then never heard back. Again. These were a Christmas gift and it's now almost January and no socks. Their website guaranteed they'd be here for Christmas. I ordered them in November. I looked at other reviews and it looks like they've been reported to the BBB more than a few times. The idea is cute, but I wouldn't recommend ordering from them. You'll be out $30 for socks!"
PupSocks,2020-12-29T17:56:34Z,5,I think the socks are really cute and I am glad that my purchase is helping feed dogs/cats through the Humane Society! The socks did take what I thought was a long time to arrive but I think that was due to USPS service delays.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T17:52:41Z,5,I bought two pair for family members for Christmas and the socks were a huge hit...the order was processed quickly and the likeness of our dog is amazing!  I'm also told they're quite comfy!  :)
PupSocks,2020-12-29T17:52:22Z,1,I ordered my socks on Nov 30. They are still not here on Dec 29. You have not replied to any of my communications. I will never buy from you again.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T17:52:14Z,5,Ordering was easy and the socks came out great! They were a gift for a new dog owner and they were a big hit.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T17:50:38Z,1,"While the print for our socks came out cute, the fabric is terribly uncomfortable--neither soft nor breathable. My daughters will never wear these."
PupSocks,2020-12-29T17:47:35Z,1,How can I review something I never received???
PupSocks,2020-12-29T17:46:55Z,1,I got the wrong order. I’ve emailed customer service and haven’t got a response
PupSocks,2020-12-29T17:46:39Z,2,"They are late, very expensive and don’t fit worth a damn. No happy with my purchase at all..."
PupSocks,2020-12-29T17:45:52Z,1,Seriously?!? You sent me this? Wow. Almost a month and still no product. No update. You can blame the post office all you want but you haven’t even shipped my order.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T17:45:19Z,1,"This was a bad experience, I placed my order on 11/30/2020. Received an email that my shipping label was created on 12/12/2020. No further updates or responses to emails. Finally received my order on 12/23/2020. I was missing 1 pair of socks and paid extra for a gift box which I did not receive. It’s 12/29 and my missing socks are in production based off of the website. This was a Christmas gift and I am very disappointed. The CEO passed the blame onto the USPS. However I don’t believe that was the case."
PupSocks,2020-12-29T17:45:11Z,2,"I was not impressed at all, very stiff material and I purchased 3 pairs and 2 of them did not fit my sons. Disappointed for the money spent."
PupSocks,2020-12-29T17:43:24Z,5,My socks are so cute!!! Love them and came just like they said.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T17:41:07Z,5,Perfect birthday present for the person who has everything! Pupsocks arrived quicker than expected! My Dad loved them!
PupSocks,2020-12-29T17:40:02Z,5,Ordering was easy and all the shipping updates from beginning to end were extremely helpful. Would def order from again. Socks are soft but don’t stretch well at the top. Boyfriend has big calves (soccer player) so they keep sliding off and doggos face is stretched out too.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T17:38:53Z,1,"I never received my order.  It was placed on December 1, 2020 and I sent at least three emails to ""customer service"" only to receive automated responses.  No phone number to contact so it appears this company managed to take my $150 and not deliver a product."
PupSocks,2020-12-29T17:38:45Z,5,"Wonderful product, warmed my heart.  Quick turnaround, no mistakes, great customer service.  Will order again!"
PupSocks,2020-12-29T17:38:02Z,1,"Very disappointed, I ordered on Nov 30- told I would have items 10-14 days.  Didn’t receive until after Christmas.  I sent 2 messages and never got a response back.  They were Christmas gifts that did not make it under the tree. Sadly I will not be ordering from this company again.."
PupSocks,2020-12-29T17:37:46Z,5,Ordered socks with images of both our dogs and cats! Everyone was very pleased! Terrific gifts!
PupSocks,2020-12-29T17:37:14Z,1,Haven’t even received the socks and it is 1 month later
PupSocks,2020-12-29T17:35:11Z,4,We ordered the cat blanket and socks bundle and the dog blanket and socks bundle.  My daughters loved them and haven’t stopped using their blankets.  The blankets are nice quality and photos turned out well.  The socks are nice thickness but the toe area is a bit large.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T17:35:00Z,1,"First, they don’t even look like socks....just long stretched out tubes of fabric with no shape and no elastic at the top. Second, they took a very long time to arrive and I received no communication from the company after I placed my order....no confirmation, no expected date of arrival, no shipping information. I would not recommend and will not order from them again."
PupSocks,2020-12-29T17:33:14Z,5,My Pupsocks came out amazing! Thank you so much!
PupSocks,2020-12-29T17:32:53Z,1,"If I could give this company negative stars, I would. One star is to high in my opinion. I ordered my blanket on December 1st. Come Christmas, nothing. I finally received it WOTH SOMEONE ELSE’S PET ON IT. Then when I try to contact them for a refund, surprise surprise, there is no phone number, anD their email doesn’t work. Their “Ask Questions” section on their website says they’ll answer in two hours. It’s been 3 days and NOTHING. This company has an F rating from the Better Business Bureau. DO NOT waste your money. This company deserves to go out of business. Just go to their Facebook page and read the comments. You’ll see all you need to know."
PupSocks,2020-12-29T17:31:53Z,5,I ordered three pairs of pup socks for christmas socks and they were a real hit!  They loved them.  The socks are good quality and the pics of the dogs show up well.  This is a great gift for anyone.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T17:30:24Z,1,"I placed 2 orders, 1 was shipped incorrectly, 1 has never arrived. They have basically no customer service. They do not respond therefore they do not fix incorrect orders or give you your money back."
PupSocks,2020-12-29T17:28:54Z,5,Everyone loved their gifts!  Thank you for such a unique idea!
PupSocks,2020-12-29T17:27:31Z,5,"My daughter loved her PupSocks with the sweet face of her new puppy. Even though the postal service was a bit delayed, your company was above and beyond in providing excellent customer service!"
PupSocks,2020-12-29T17:26:48Z,5,So cute! Turned out better than expected.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T17:26:16Z,1,I ordered November 20....still haven’t gotten anything! They have ignored me and haven’t issued new product or a refund.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T17:25:30Z,5,I love my blanket with my furbabies!! Blanket is so soft and big.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T17:24:36Z,1,We havn’t received the order yet. Once I get them I can properly review them.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T17:23:22Z,1,I ordered two masks on 11/30. They have not been shipped yet however I did get an email to show what I purchased and that was wrong. Wonder if these are coming from China or just a plain ole scam.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T17:22:25Z,1,"I placed the order on 11/30 I finally received them on 12/28 and they are not what I ordered. Plus I can't get in touch with anyone, no one is responding to my emails."
PupSocks,2020-12-29T17:20:54Z,2,"My two orders (ordered in Nov) never did arrive. They were meant to be for Christmas gifts so this was quite disappointing. I messaged the company twice about this already....the first reply indicated that the socks are on their way however absolutely no reply to my second inquiry. While the socks themselves may be great (although I’ll have to review that part after I get them), the customer service has not been great I’m afraid.  I don’t think I would order again based on this experience."
PupSocks,2020-12-29T17:20:08Z,4,"Family loved the socks, 4/5 for sure, great idea for fun gifts all year long. We used them as stocking stuffers for Christmas. Socks seem like they are quality made and the photos wont be washed away to quickly. Only time will tell on that though. Only opinion outside of that is hope the company continues to grow so the manufacturing options can be a little easier on price and options for bundle packs. We have two cats and a dog. Would have like a 3 pack bundle of each individual without blowing the bank. We opted for all 3 pets on one which made the family happy. Also I realize the cropping around the pets heads is all on the photo you give, but could use a little better/attentive job on the edging work. In this day and age, we've got the technology. Good luck pup socks - great idea."
PupSocks,2020-12-29T17:19:57Z,1,Not only did they take 3+ weeks to arrive but they were the wrong color and it had someone else’s dog.  Definitely wasn’t my dog.  Emailed to complain and no one has got back to me - in fact Gmail said it couldn’t even deliver the second message.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T17:19:05Z,5,We were so happy with our initial order that we placed a second order.  Absolutely LOVE our pup socks and will order again in the future.  Thank you!
PupSocks,2020-12-29T17:19:02Z,2,"I ordered my item on the 1st of December, did not receive a proof. Emailed numerous times with no response after my package had not left their warehouse after a week. It is almost New Year's and my Wife still does not have her gift. Weeks later, they sent a proof, they removed fur around my dog's face that distorted how she looks dramatically. No responses to anything I have sent them. I am not happy that I paid $30 for socks that do not look like my dog and took over a month to get here."
PupSocks,2020-12-29T17:17:59Z,1,"I hate leaving low reviews, but I can't see any way around this one. I ordered a pair of socks for a Christmas gift directly after Thanksgiving. I never received an email to sign off on the design, just an email letting me know they were on their way. They arrived mostly on time, but there was a different dog on the socks. I reached out to customer service and received an automatic email that it would be around 72 hours before I would receive a response. That's been over a week ago and the closest thing I've received to a response is what looked like another mass email offering discounts on future orders. I have reached out through email. I have reached out through social media. I would have settled for receiving the correct socks, but now I need a full refund or I'll start the process of a chargeback.Please have someone reach out and resolve this ASAP."
PupSocks,2020-12-29T17:17:48Z,5,Excellent customer service! Love the quality of the socks. Totally worth the wait! Thank you for the transparency and communication throughout the busy holiday week! Love love love the socks 😃
PupSocks,2020-12-29T17:12:04Z,3,"My husband loved socks with our dogs picture on it, but he says the socks are very uncomfortable. Not a lot of stretch and not soft."
PupSocks,2020-12-29T17:11:02Z,5,"We added this item to our daughter's Christmas list with pics of our lab Gator and her mini-bull terrier named Goose. While we were super impressed by the quality, she loved the image of our dogs and has already put the socks and blanket to use. Excellent. The ONLY advice would be to order early as it didn't arrive until Christmas Eve. Phew. Crisis averted."
PupSocks,2020-12-29T17:10:30Z,5,"I gave two pairs of pup socks as Christmas gifts, and both recipients LOVED them! They were a big hit! I got a cat mask for myself as well, and I love it! I was very pleased with my purchases and would definitely order from this company again!"
PupSocks,2020-12-29T17:09:11Z,5,"Even with the holiday rush of shipping, my socks came in within 3 weeks of ordering. The smallest size was a little big for my 4 year old nephew, but I definitely won Christmas for him! He loves my dog and doesn’t own one. Thank you Pup Socks!"
PupSocks,2020-12-29T17:08:27Z,1,I received my package with no socks inside and have not had any assistance in getting a new pair. I sent photos showing a ripped open envelope/bag and a note from the post office stating that’s how it arrived.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T17:07:49Z,1,Haven't recieved package.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T17:00:58Z,1,I have never received the socks.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T16:55:44Z,1,"One of the dogs was left out completely.  Also, they were all too small"
PupSocks,2020-12-29T16:54:59Z,1,I’m disappointed with this company I placed my order on November 30 it is now December 29 and I still haven’t received my order yet. It was supposed to be a Christmas present.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T16:53:18Z,1,"I regret ever clicking on the Facebook ad for this company - not only did they miss the shipping date by weeks (I ordered nearly 4 weeks before Xmas and they arrived on Dec 28th) so that I don't have an easy way to gift these socks anymore, but their customer service team might as well be non-existent as they ignored multiple emails and messages on social media.  TLDR: cool product, incompetent company"
PupSocks,2020-12-29T16:51:32Z,5,Very cute. Arrived quickly. Quality seems good but time will tell. Thanks!
PupSocks,2020-12-29T16:51:12Z,1,"Well I really want to give you a good review BUT I still do not have the socks that I ordered in early November.  These were supposed to be Christmas gifts.  And with the exchange (US to Canada) and shipping, I basically spent $150 on 4 pairs of socks!!  Socks that did not even come in yet.  So I am frustrated.  I realize this may not be your fault and may be due to covid but I cannot give a good review at this point.  When I get the socks I will review again."
PupSocks,2020-12-29T16:50:24Z,4,"They get a little backed up on production during the Christmas rush, but still delivered the product before the holiday.  Very cute product."
PupSocks,2020-12-29T16:49:19Z,1,"Garbage company, placed an order December 1 for Christmas and not only has it still not arrived by today, December 29, but I’ve not been able to get any response from the company other than a canned auto response. Shop somewhere else."
PupSocks,2020-12-29T16:48:51Z,2,"The socks don't fit properly, they gather around the ankle."
PupSocks,2020-12-29T16:44:13Z,5,Worth it! Turned out great!
PupSocks,2020-12-29T16:36:29Z,3,Design is fun. Socks are poor quality and incredibly difficult to put on.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T16:35:27Z,5,My nephew loved the socks. They turned out great.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T16:32:15Z,4,"I removed one star because the material is a bit slippery and weird. The toe bed is also pretty wide, but that might change after washing. Anyway, I'm still happy because I love having my cat's dumb face on my socks!"
PupSocks,2020-12-29T16:31:44Z,4,"Bought as a gift for Christmas, husband loved them. I will say the bottom has rubbed a bit so that’s something to consider, after the first wear they look pretty worn already."
PupSocks,2020-12-29T16:31:41Z,1,This was a Christmas present ordered on December 8 and I STILL have not received!!!  Not happy happy at all!!!!  You are a disappointment.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T16:31:12Z,1,"Never got my socks, never heard back from anyone on my order status and kept my money. Would never recommend this company to anyone."
PupSocks,2020-12-29T16:27:49Z,5,"Product was good quality, photo of dog was clear, shipment on time.Everything we expected!"
PupSocks,2020-12-29T16:27:45Z,3,"Cute Christmas present for the wife. She liked them, but.... Sock fit is very bad. Squared toe area and terrible buching in front of the ankle because they are tube socks. Warm weather socks only, very thin, but I understand this because printing on thicker socks may be hard."
PupSocks,2020-12-29T16:27:15Z,5,Very happy with the overall quality.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T16:16:13Z,4,"The socks and face masks I ordered came out great! Only issue that I have is with the quality of the socks themselves, wish that they would be thicker so they last longer."
PupSocks,2020-12-29T16:11:50Z,1,I still have not received my order. Zero communication until I reached out !! I finally received a generic email saying they are working on the problem. I would not recommend this website!!!
PupSocks,2020-12-29T16:07:56Z,5,Socks looked awesome. Great gift.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T16:07:33Z,1,Had the balls to ask for a review and I still haven't received my order (after a month).And they missed Christmas (by a long shot)
PupSocks,2020-12-29T16:04:44Z,2,Ordered my Christmas presents from pup socks a month in advance and it took them 19 days to get the order to the post office and 30 days later I still don’t have my order and I had to buy new Christmas presents. These socks are not cheap and I’m disappointed it took them so long to get them to the post office.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T16:00:44Z,5,I ordered socks for my daughter with a picture of her cat Blackberry on them for Christmas.  She flipped!  They are so cute!  Now she can enjoy wearing socks with her cat's picture on them while she is away at college.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T16:00:31Z,5,"Socks came as advertised, shipped when promised, Great experience!"
PupSocks,2020-12-29T15:58:12Z,1,It's kind of hard to review when I haven't received them and have been waiting for over a month for their delivery.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T15:55:48Z,5,My wife loved he blanket and socks. It is probably the best Christmas gift I have ever purchased. Extremely happy!!
PupSocks,2020-12-29T15:54:52Z,3,Ordered it Beginning December and did not get until after Christmas not happy
PupSocks,2020-12-29T15:53:01Z,1,"Ordered item in November, item still not arrived Dec 29, 2020. No updates from company on shipping or when e-mailing the contact line on my order."
PupSocks,2020-12-29T15:49:29Z,1,Ordered my Pup socks as a Christmas gift they never arrived and I’m still waiting on Dec 29th.My order was placed November 30th.One month and counting 😤
PupSocks,2020-12-29T15:48:19Z,1,"My order took a full month to complete (it’s hopefully supposed to arrive today), and instead for Christmas I had to give my sister a printout of a poor quality mock-up of my order. I tried to reach out to pup socks many times while I was waiting on my order to try to find out what had happened, I was never able to speak to anyone with the company. I am incredibly frustrated with pup socks, and will definitely never order from them again. Please avoid this company!"
PupSocks,2020-12-29T15:46:20Z,1,They didn't arrive for Christmas which is incredibly disappointing. I was offered a discount on my next purchase but I should be getting a full refund.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T15:46:18Z,1,Extremely disappointed. I ordered two pairs on December 1st. I ordered these for Christmas for my kids and I still have yet to receive them (it's December 29th today).I ordered a pair last year and had no issues.It isn't just about the delivery company because the processing time took over a week before they were shipped out this year.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T15:46:08Z,3,"Nice concept. But the socks themselves are such garbage, almost comically unwearable. What is that fabric you are using??? So while it’s nice to have socks with a picture of the cat on them, it’s sort of defeats the purpose if the pattern and the material of the sock itself looks like and feels like it was made by a first grader.  Get it together you guys. You could do the same work with better quality and you know it."
PupSocks,2020-12-29T15:45:20Z,3,"The socks looked great with the photo I sent of my dog, but they were too small and not the most comfortable socks, I was a little disappointed for the price I paid."
PupSocks,2020-12-29T15:44:10Z,1,"I am sorry to say, that I have not had A positive experience with this company. I ordered some customize gifts for my husband with our dogs face on them.Unfortunately, when I received my item it was incorrect. I have reached out several times and have have not had any resolution.I am very disappointed."
PupSocks,2020-12-29T15:43:32Z,1,I ordered gifts for my kids for Hannukah on December 1 and they still have not arrived. Horrible customer service. I have reached out 3 times to inquire about the status of my order and have heard nothing back from anyone.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T15:43:01Z,2,Poor quality. Would never purchase again. Cheap crummy looking. Very disappointed.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T15:41:19Z,1,I received knee high socks & I ordered ankle socks. I have emailed customer service & not heard back. Not a satisfied customer!
PupSocks,2020-12-29T15:39:23Z,1,Unfortunately I still haven’t received them so I can’t really give you a good review
PupSocks,2020-12-29T15:37:21Z,1,"I have yet to receive my order!  It was placed December 11th with a confirmation e-mail stating product to ship 3-5 business days.  18 days later, still no socks.  I was forced to go out Christmas Eve and purchase a last minute gift for the receiver of these socks.  Also, the tracking number that was supplied does not work.  DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY.  THEY ARE BOGUS"
PupSocks,2020-12-29T15:34:48Z,5,"My family loves being able to wear their sweet pets on their feet. Fast shipping, quality material. Thank you! Will wear again."
PupSocks,2020-12-29T15:29:33Z,5,I ordered cat socks and a cat mask. Everything looks great! Very good material and the pictures are perfect. Thank you! I will order again.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T15:29:00Z,5,"I received the pup socks after Christmas but, hey, it’s 2020 and life is a dumpster fire. I was delighted however at the quality. The fabric seems to be much different from anything I’ve ever seen in socks but my granddaughter was thrilled, especially when she told me the dog looked a lot like Molly and I told her it was Molly! Thanks for working with me, pup socks to get the correct size."
PupSocks,2020-12-29T15:23:35Z,1,The picture on the socks was poorly portrayed. It did not look like the picture I sent in. I want my money back and/or replacement.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T15:22:41Z,1,I still have not received my order that I placed on November 30th. It was supposed to be a Christmas gift.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T15:20:45Z,5,I am very happy with my purchase of socks.  They are good quality and the picture of my dog was perfect.  Thank you SO much!!!
PupSocks,2020-12-29T15:20:27Z,1,"Still have not received my products, no communication or support, just a silly email showing what my product would look like.  Do not order from them...should care more about their customers."
PupSocks,2020-12-29T15:16:41Z,1,"I received my order 3 days after Christmas. I had put the order in plenty early. I ordered 3 pair of socks, using pics of two different white dogs. The two pair I got of the one white dog are fine. On the other pair of socks my daughter’s dog has half an orange face. It looks nothing like her dog. Her dog is pure white. The other dogs pics are all white like he is. I don’t know if it was supposed to look like shading or what but it’s half orange, half white like a calico cat. I would either like my money back or a pair of socks without the orange."
PupSocks,2020-12-29T15:15:15Z,5,I gave pupsocks to my kids and grandkids for Christmas and they absolutely loved them! The colors were bright and fun and the photos of the dogs were very well cropped and placed on the socks. They were the hit of the holiday!
PupSocks,2020-12-29T15:05:52Z,1,"I ordered a pair of socks for a Christmas gift in November and still waiting for it to come. I also ordered a puzzle much much later and am getting it today. I understand it might take a little longer with the mail situation, however, I think 6 weeks and still not here, way too long. I would like to know if you actually have it or did you loose it?"
PupSocks,2020-12-29T15:05:03Z,1,"Ordered in end november, still no delivery and no answer when writing to the contacts on homepages"
PupSocks,2020-12-29T15:04:32Z,5,"Ordered 2 pairs for my son for Christmas, one with our Beagle, the other with our 2 cats. He loved them!! They looked great!"
PupSocks,2020-12-29T14:59:26Z,5,"My husband loves his new PupSocks! Very comfy, fit is good, and there's our Riley surrounded by bones and paws! Perfect Christmas gift."
PupSocks,2020-12-29T14:58:22Z,5,"Looks great, I had 4 dogs added and their photos we cropped to the socks very nicely. The order arrived quickly despite ordering them late in December."
PupSocks,2020-12-29T14:54:47Z,5,I think they look GREAT!  Have ordered another pair.  Excited to give them as gifts!  They will always remember their special pet!
PupSocks,2020-12-29T14:54:22Z,1,The XL socks were way too narrow for my husband to even get on his feet. It was such a disappointment.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T14:46:04Z,5,"Great service, great socks. They run a little big, but they were the winning gift this year! Everyone put them on immediately, after they realized it was their dog/cat on the socks! We had both done and they are the BEST!"
PupSocks,2020-12-29T14:42:37Z,1,"I ordered the mask and socks. Husband put mask on and it fell off face. Once we shortened ear ties by tying knots in them, the fit was better. They are simply cloth masks without a nose bridge or filter holder. Cute with our pets face on them, but nothing fancy. Not worth price charged and unsure if it’s manly enough that he’ll wear it. It’s a novelty for sure. On to the socks, cute too but husband can’t wear them. There is no stretch in them and way too tight on his legs. They are even too tight on my legs but if you need cute compression socks, these do the trick. FYI, my guy is 6’0 and weighs 195.  Don’t get me wrong, the printing job was done well and I appreciate it but in my opinion, not worth price charged.  The whole idea is to have your pets face printed so we can show how much we love our pets. Spend your 50 bucks more wisely (and this was with their Christmas discount)!"
PupSocks,2020-12-29T14:05:28Z,5,These were a huge hit with all recipients. Such a small gift that packed a huge punch. :)
PupSocks,2020-12-29T13:53:18Z,1,"Ordered back in November and on Dec 24 I got a message saying they aren’t ready yet. So I spent $100 on 4 pair of socks to be Christmas presents which never came and all I got was a 40% off for my next purchase. Ya, I won’t be doing that again. I am disappointed and upset."
PupSocks,2020-12-29T13:51:25Z,5,"The Pup Socks were Great! I gave them to my son for Christmas. As soon as he opened his present, he took one look at them and said, ""That's Wesson!"" They did a great job! Perfect! He Loves his dog, And therefore he loves the socks! Thanks, Best gift ever!"
PupSocks,2020-12-29T13:39:07Z,5,Amazing gift! Perfect stocking stuffers and great job with the photo editing. It was a hit!
PupSocks,2020-12-29T13:19:23Z,1,"I had ordered socks before. The quality is mediocre at best but the concept cute.  I have had delivery issues before as well including no gift wrap or message despite paying extra for it. I decided to try one more time and ordered 2 masks and dog blanket for my daughter for Xmas.  Despite placing the order on 12/1, it not only hasn't been delivered but USPS says only that a label has been created, not even clear if it is at the post office.  Repeated attempts to get answers from the company have yielded nothing - no explanation, no answers, no response except to say packages are delayed.  I will never order from this company again."
PupSocks,2020-12-29T13:16:44Z,1,"It took about 20 days to get my socks and when I finally got them, they had the wrong dog pictured. I have emailed about this twice to get it fixed but haven’t received a solution. Do not buy from here!!"
PupSocks,2020-12-29T13:02:49Z,1,"Still haven't received my socks, I ordered them well in advance of Christmas to make sure they would come in time. I think they are still in Miami or something as per the tracking and I live in Canada. Very disappointed with the timing and the website promised it would come before Christmas. I reached out to the support team multiple times, via email, facebook, instagram and received no response!!!! Wouldn't recommend and wouldn't order products again due to the lack of customer service and I am hoping it is good quality and I get them soon or I will be even more disappointed."
PupSocks,2020-12-29T12:57:55Z,4,Cute .  This was a gift and it made the recipient laugh !  Object achieved !
PupSocks,2020-12-29T12:51:35Z,5,The socks were the perfect gift.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T12:11:54Z,1,I ordered two pairs of socks and one blanket. The blanket came in wrong and the two pairs of socks never showed up. They were ordered at the same time. I sent an email explaining both issues and have not heard back even though it’s been over a week since I sent the email. There isn’t a phone number to call either
PupSocks,2020-12-29T11:59:34Z,1,The socks are made of an unusual material. The design of the socks has no shape and are particularly wide.On a positive- the photos of the animals are very clear.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T11:50:40Z,5,Excellent quality and fast service!
PupSocks,2020-12-29T11:35:54Z,5,"The picture looks good, happy with the purchase."
PupSocks,2020-12-29T11:32:36Z,5,My sons favorite Christmas gift.  The blanket was adorable and great quality. I wasn’t sure what to expect and I was pleasantly surprised.  I’ve recommended this business to all of my friends and family!
PupSocks,2020-12-29T11:17:29Z,2,"First, let me say that I LOVE Pusocks. It’s been a hit for gifts and is now a go to. I am just not impressed with the masks at all. They are too small to cover my partner’s (male) face. The strings around the ears are so long that it’s necessary to tie knots. There is no way to adjust the length of the strings except to tie knots. After 9 or so months of wearing masks, I guess I have come to have expectations about how they should be."
PupSocks,2020-12-29T10:02:00Z,1,"The advertisement shows nice looking cotton socks, however the actual quality is so bad that I would actually deem this business venture as a scam!! The people who are behind this company should take a look at themselves in the mirror."
PupSocks,2020-12-29T09:35:31Z,5,Very cute did a nice job getting my pup’s picture on the socks
PupSocks,2020-12-29T08:56:06Z,1,"Made my order on Nov. 27th and still haven't received anything... so far, wasting my money is all I can speak to."
PupSocks,2020-12-29T08:16:03Z,5,This is my second purchase with pupsocks and I couldn’t be happier with the results. High quality material and paw-some design. Thanks again!
PupSocks,2020-12-29T08:08:29Z,1,The product is really amazing but I haven't received it yet. I bought it online because it mentioned 1 day delivery its now more than 2 months. I feel really bad for this comment but I really can't recomend you.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T07:47:00Z,2,Was a christmas present. I ordered in late november and it said it would be up to 15 business days and i still havent gotten them and its december 29th
PupSocks,2020-12-29T07:19:49Z,5,"Great product, socks are very comfortable and provides good support, loved giving my family socks featuring our black lab- made a super fun Christmas gift for all. They were definitely a big hit! Thank you"
PupSocks,2020-12-29T06:37:29Z,1,I was suppose to receive a credit for 89 and no one has done it and it has been 3 weeks
PupSocks,2020-12-29T06:24:07Z,5,My daughter and wife each liked their socks with their dog’s faces. Made for a unique and personalized gift.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T06:16:27Z,5,These were a gift for mu daughter and she loved them.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T06:08:32Z,5,Love those socks!!!
PupSocks,2020-12-29T06:07:22Z,1,"Socks are great quality. Picture is not the greatest but that could just be the pictures we sent in. Customer service is horrible, that is the reason for the 1-star. Doesn’t respond after multiple attempts. A great 1-time gift."
PupSocks,2020-12-29T05:45:08Z,5,so cute!! thank u
PupSocks,2020-12-29T05:44:48Z,1,"I placed an order on 11/29/2020 (yes, I know all about the issues of 2020) for Christmas. I haven’t gotten any information in my order other than it’s in production and if I want I can get 50% off my next order.  Whenever I send an email about it’s status, I get a robo email response—same one every time. And before the order has been completed, shipped or delivered I got this wonderfully timed “How did we do” survey. Sorry, this is my first 1-star review of anyone, even during these trying times. Clean up your automated emails and it might be a different response."
PupSocks,2020-12-29T05:36:05Z,5,Looks great!
PupSocks,2020-12-29T05:31:03Z,1,Product not received.  It had advertised a quick production date which was not correct.  It was about 5 business days.  After that they did not get my package to the shipping  company.  I ordered about Nov 17th and there is no way to tellIf I will get them or if they are the right socks.  So many bad reviews are it there unfortunately I’m not sure I’ll get the right product if I ever do.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T05:16:08Z,5,My daughter loves them. They came before Christmas as promised
PupSocks,2020-12-29T05:06:32Z,5,"Looks great, thanks!"
PupSocks,2020-12-29T05:04:10Z,1,"Ordered a gift on Thanksgiving and still haven't recieved it. Website says it's been shipped but USPS says they didn't receive it.... lots of confusion, got a generic email from the company saying items ordered for the holiday will be shipped in time but still nothing and Christmas has come and gone..... 🤷‍♀️"
PupSocks,2020-12-29T04:54:26Z,5,Love my cat blanket even more than I thought I would! Image quality is beautiful. Worth the wait!
PupSocks,2020-12-29T04:48:05Z,1,Ordered more than a month ago. Still haven’t received my order. Shipping status provided hasn’t changed in more than 3 weeks. Unsure what to do. Was looking forward to gifting these.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T04:40:51Z,1,"I received someone else’s socks with a random cat. And, there was no response from anyone through email for weeks when I sent my message trying to ask for help. I ordered in November well before Christmas. Plus, there is no number to call so you are left without help until they decide to get back to you. They sure will take your money right away though! Once I did get a response they just said they were reprinting and still have not received my socks weeks later... for whoever wants to know, try DivvyUp, they were great!"
PupSocks,2020-12-29T04:40:38Z,5,Thank you!!! Such a great gift!!!
PupSocks,2020-12-29T04:39:53Z,3,"I ordered a few pairs a few years ago and both pairs were great. I ordered this new pair for a girl and they look like man socks. I still gave them as a gift, but had to explain I thought they were going to be better than they were"
PupSocks,2020-12-29T04:34:49Z,1,Placed an order on Nov 30 intended as a Christmas present. Confirmation email told me “you can expect to receive your order in 8-10 business days”. They didn’t even ship the order until Dec 21. As of Dec 28 still no delivery. Absolutely useless. Complete bait & switch. If they ever show up they will be returned.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T04:27:26Z,2,"I ordered and paid for two pair of socks on Nov. 30, 2020 and have yet to receive them (this being Dec. 28) although payment was deducted from my account.  They were to be Christmas presents.  Yet, I received an e-mail recently from your website advertising that if an order was placed by Dec. 20, shipment would arrive before the New Year.  That’s 11-days.  I’ve been waiting 28+.  I’m extremely disappointed."
PupSocks,2020-12-29T04:21:33Z,4,"The process was easy and fast. The socks were OK, not as comfy as I would have liked."
PupSocks,2020-12-29T04:18:11Z,4,My kids loved their socks and were excited to get them! They thought it was hilarious to have their dog on socks.  I was disappointed in the color of the dog images on the socks—they had a yellowish-looking tint to them. Hoped they would come out clearer.  The kids still love them!
PupSocks,2020-12-29T04:14:03Z,5,Love the blanket. High quality and soft . Our cat will be immortalized.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T03:59:20Z,5,They are cute. Took longer to arrive than was quoted but they are very cute and did get to me before Christmas.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T03:57:43Z,5,The photo was were so clear and detailed! The color is eye popping.  My mom absolutely loves her socks with her pup's face all over them!
PupSocks,2020-12-29T03:50:40Z,1,"No response from customer service after failing to ever even ship my supposedly ""done"" order before or after Christmas. I paid extra for guranteed by Christmas shipping. Got an email that they were done and had a FedEx shipping label printed by the 20th, then 8 days later... NOTHING. Never shipped. Customer service won't even answer an email or chat. Why isn't 0 stars an option?? I wish I had read the other similar reviews first. Now I need to waste time trying to figure out how to get a refund from a company that won't even answer their customers."
PupSocks,2020-12-29T03:43:50Z,2,The picture was exactly as I asked for but as far as the socks go they are terrible. Not a sock that can be worn regularly but rather a gag gift. For a $30 pair of socks I expected much better
PupSocks,2020-12-29T03:43:07Z,1,The wrong socks were delivered to my recipient. Still waiting for the company to advise when this will be corrected.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T03:39:45Z,5,Bought socks for a Christmas gift. They came out exactly as I anticipated and they did a great job isolating her dogs head in the pic.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T03:21:45Z,1,"Extremely slow production and shipping times should certainly be mentioned by your company during the holiday season as many, including me, have ordered your product as a gift.  Extremely disappointed.  The holidays are long gone and I’ve yet to receive my order."
PupSocks,2020-12-29T03:19:37Z,5,The pup socks are so fun and were a huge hit! My only regret is not ordering a pair for the entire family!
PupSocks,2020-12-29T03:18:20Z,2,Takes FOREVER to arrive. Pretty disappointed.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T03:18:11Z,1,I was sent the wrong socks and it's been 2 weeks and I've not received an update. On getting the correct order.   Custom service basically doesn't exist.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T03:17:49Z,2,Ordered my socks 30 days ago and still have not received them. They were a Christmas present. So I was unable to give that as a gift for Christmas. Highly disappointed
PupSocks,2020-12-29T03:11:34Z,1,I sent a good picture but where my dog snout is white it was all blue on the socks and mask.  My dogs snout is not blue
PupSocks,2020-12-29T03:10:19Z,1,"If there was a zero stars choice, that would be mine. This is a dishonest company with an F rating with the Better Business Bureau for good reason. Still have not received my Nov 29th order. All my customer service inquires went unanswered. Just take a quick look at PupSocks’Twitter and Facebook feeds to see how abhorrent they are. I am only one of many they’ve scammed — for years, apparently. Had to file a claim with my bank, and PupSocks had placed a “token” on my credit card, which forced my bank to cancel my card and issue a new one so PupSocks could not scam me out of my money. Many people missing orders or receiving incredibly late orders only to open their packages and find animals they did not know on their orders — PupSocks had sent them someone else’s order. Do not order from this company. They have gotten away with this for years. It’s past time it stops."
PupSocks,2020-12-29T02:53:42Z,2,I was disappointed in the material the socks are made of.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T02:50:33Z,5,The socks are adorable!  Very comfortable too!
PupSocks,2020-12-29T02:50:17Z,4,"Very fun product!  Took longer than expected since it was ordered in November and didn't arrive until after Christmas, but socks are cute and blanket is pretty."
PupSocks,2020-12-29T02:41:40Z,5,Best Xmas present ever for my wife from our kids.  Our son found the blanket and I sent in face pics of our 2 cats and dog. It was very easy to order and the blanket turned out awesome!!! Super soft and the pic collage is exactly what they look like.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T02:39:52Z,5,"I ordered socks for my Mom for Christmas through PupSocks - I took a fun photo of our family cat and had them added to a Christmas argyle themed sock...and oh my gosh, they turned out SO wonderfully! I was so impressed with the skills the team used to crop the photo of our Reggie - and the sock quality is quite high too! When my Mom opened the gift up, she was SHOCKED and so AMAZED! Thank you, PupSocks - I can't wait to recommend your services to all my friends & family! Love the work that you do!"
PupSocks,2020-12-29T02:26:54Z,1,"This is the worst customer service I have ever been a part of. I order and am told it will ship in 3-5 days. I then get an email 10 days later saying they are behind but the order will ship in a few days. After 2 weeks I start a chat with their customer service looking for a time frame for when I will get my socks that have my dog’s face on them who since died from a quick bout with cancer during this whole time. I got an automated response saying I would hear back within 24 hrs. As I am waiting for my response for 2 days I get a notification that my order has shipped. This is now 17 days after it was being shipped in a few and 27 days after it was being shipped in 3-5 days. Then the icing on the cake. I get the socks. They’re ok. But 12 days after I send a message in a chat, I get a freaking response finally. And it says you order shows it has been delivered thank you for choosing pup socks. Are you serious? Please don’t make the mistake I did and support these people. I’m sure Etsy has way better people and products that could be like this. I received no apology, no we’d like to make things right. Just a statement of fact that my order was delivered. This place is a joke don’t waste your time, money and most importantly don’t do what my wife and I did and waste our excitement to have our 5 year old pups face who we miss so much back in our house. They don’t care about their customers. They just want to sell product."
PupSocks,2020-12-29T02:25:18Z,1,"I never leave reviews, good or bad, but this calls for it. I placed my order a week before Thanksgiving thinking that would be plenty of time for the socks to arrive before Christmas and boy was I mistaken. They were just delivered 5 weeks late and surprise, they were someone else's order. Not only that, but the socks are essentially made of plastic, I'm seriously questioning if they were 3D printed from recycled plastic bottles. Will be asking for my money back. Luckily printing photos on socks is not proprietary, so no need to waste your time with this company."
PupSocks,2020-12-29T02:23:07Z,5,"They are adorable!  My 14yr old daughter loves, loves them!!"
PupSocks,2020-12-29T02:17:26Z,1,I haven't received my socks yet  but you want me to post a review?
PupSocks,2020-12-29T02:09:53Z,1,The socks are TERRIBLE. Impossible to actually wear and not even in the shape of a sock. Super disappointed.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T02:04:00Z,5,The socks are great and it made a great gift!
PupSocks,2020-12-29T02:02:56Z,1,"It would be nice if I had a produce to review, 2 different orders and have not received one.  First pair of socks, second sock, mask and blanket none received and order placed beginning of Dec."
PupSocks,2020-12-29T02:01:24Z,1,Merchandise never arrived. There is no one to speak to ? Will be dealing with this through my credit card.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T02:01:11Z,5,"Our daughter loved these. She was so excited and amazed when she opened these on Christmas morning. She kept saying ""but that's Bayly's face!"" Worth every penny!!"
PupSocks,2020-12-29T01:58:55Z,5,The ordering process was easy.  I emailed a question prior to ordering and received a response within 24 hrs.  The product was delivered quickly.  The socks are awesome!!  Everyone has loved them. I recommended this product to a friend.  She was also pleased with her purchase.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T01:41:00Z,1,"The socks ordered and received versus those that appear on the main page of the website (as well as throughout the Instagram profile for the company) are NOT the same. The socks delivered are, quite simply, cheaply made knitted tubes with the end sewn shut. No heel as shown in the hero image of the website. Will be asking for money back. The website states: Product Image DisclaimerPlease note that although we make every effort to photograph our products accurately and describe them in detail, we cannot guarantee every photograph in production will accurately depict the actual color of the merchandise due to changes in screen resolution. Please contact us with any questions about the color, material, or size of an item before purchasing.""This is an issue of not showing the product that you will in fact receive. Extremely let down with this transaction."
PupSocks,2020-12-29T01:34:34Z,5,The people I gave the socks to for Christmas loved them. They were good quality and much appreciated. Thanks.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T01:27:35Z,5,This is an awesome product  the blanket and socks came out amazing .. customer service is great this is the fourth time I’ve ordered and I will definitely order again. Thank you
PupSocks,2020-12-29T01:23:17Z,3,"The order took a little longer than expected but when they came in I was super happy, the quality of the sock is nylon and not cotton but I’m sure I didn’t read through when I made this purchase. Thank you!"
PupSocks,2020-12-29T01:21:42Z,5,Pup socks did a great job with our socks. When it oils like our order was going to be late they contacted me to let me know. I liked their professionalism and my boys loved their socks! It was the hit of Christmas!
PupSocks,2020-12-29T01:20:23Z,2,"Ordered a pair of socks weeks ago. I understand covid is making this move slow, but the tracking number is hardly ever updated and you hear nothing from them."
PupSocks,2020-12-29T01:16:42Z,1,"The quality of the socks material is so cheap, the picture is blurry. Regret purchasing from them."
PupSocks,2020-12-29T01:06:19Z,1,My order was to ship on 12/4. I have yet to receive my order. I then received an email stating a 2nd pair was being sent out via USPS (which would just be dumb as that is how the first pair was shipped) or FED EX. I never received a tracking number for the 2nd pair. The first pair has still not arrived as of 12/28 and they were to be a Christmas gift. The socks could look great but I would not know as I have not received them.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T01:03:59Z,4,"Great service, great product!  Shipping process super.  Just a little too pricey."
PupSocks,2020-12-29T00:59:37Z,4,I really enjoyed the look and quality I just wasn’t a fan of how rough they were I wish they were a tad bit softer but I get it because you need to make sure that it’s printed on there.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T00:55:05Z,5,Daughter was so excited to get the socks with her puppy’s face!  Best stocking stuffer ever!
PupSocks,2020-12-29T00:48:59Z,1,Received wrong socks with someone's pet. Have been waiting for over a week to hear from someone and nobody has gotten back to me to correct the mistake.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T00:45:03Z,3,"The product itself was great.  I ordered 2 polar fleece blankets for my niece and nephew, that had their personal pets on them and they are very cute with crisp, clear images.   Unfortunately, I ordered on November 26 and didn’t receive them until December 27, after I finally contacted the company with my concerns.  Since this was a Christmas present, and Christmas is now been and gone, I now need to ship them to my family members, since they have now gone home."
PupSocks,2020-12-29T00:44:33Z,5,Pictures look Great!
PupSocks,2020-12-29T00:43:04Z,5,"These socks are GREAT!  The picture I sent and the one on the socks are a perfect match.  No guessing if it's really our dog.  Great Service!  Got them in a timely manner, even with the holidays.Highly reccomend!"
PupSocks,2020-12-29T00:40:43Z,5,"Excellent job, picture perfect on the socks"
PupSocks,2020-12-29T00:38:03Z,3,The socks are a cute novelty but really don’t fit well. I don’t think my daughter will be able to wear them. Definitely disappointed.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T00:33:29Z,5,Loved the socks Looked exactly like my daughters cat !
PupSocks,2020-12-29T00:33:20Z,1,I placed my order on 11/30. I got an email stating I would have the order in 8-10 days. It’s now 12/28 and I still don’t have the order. There’s no tracking details available and I can’t get in touch with the company. I was scammed by this company.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T00:26:55Z,1,"I haven’t even received my order yet, why are you asking me for a review? It’s been over a month. The “present” is not the same when it’s given in January."
PupSocks,2020-12-29T00:23:26Z,5,Super easy to order. Got them as a gift for my wife. She loves them!
PupSocks,2020-12-29T00:20:33Z,1,"I ordered my socks on thanksgiving night and the promotion at the time was that if I ordered by the end of the business day my order would ship the next day. My order never shipped and I ended up sending multiple emails to pup socks with no response. Finally ,I received an email apologizing for the delay but I was assured my order would be here by Christmas. Well here it is 3 days after Christmas and my order still hasn't arrived and at this point I doubt it ever will. The only reason I'm giving you a 1 star review is because I can't give a lower rating.I will be requesting a full refund for my order as well as contacting my bank to dispute the charger. I will never order from this site again.To my friends and family I will recommend any of the dozens of other websites that sell the same product but actually deliver but I will never recommend pupsocks.com"
PupSocks,2020-12-29T00:20:29Z,2,"The picture on the socks is super cute, but they aren’t very soft. I thought I had ordered a women’s 9-11 size, but they are huge. They won’t be able to be worn because they are so big"
PupSocks,2020-12-29T00:19:20Z,1,You printed socks wirh my mom's cat on it and dog bones instead of fish bones. I've sent two emails describing the mistake and asking for a reprint. In the meantime it took you a month to respond. In the email in which I sent a picture you asked me to send a picture.  And during those four weeks you flooded my inbox with promotional emails daily.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T00:07:33Z,1,The order was placed November 30 and has not been received. Tracking information is useless.
PupSocks,2020-12-29T00:02:35Z,5,"I am completely pleased with my purchases! I ordered three pair of socks, one with my yellow lab, one with my black lab and one with both their faces on one pair. The three recipients loved their gift, too!"
PupSocks,2020-12-29T00:02:19Z,4,"Happy Puppy!The socks were adorable, however, I wish the material of the socks was nicer.  The feel of the socks was very synthetic which I was disappointed in.  I wish they were made with softer material that made them look and feel comfier."
PupSocks,2020-12-28T23:55:22Z,5,My wife loved them! Perfect gift for any animal lover!
PupSocks,2020-12-28T23:52:10Z,1,"Ordered socks November 29 as a gift for Xmas party dec 20. Received email dec 7 saying order completed, given tracking #. The tracking said label created waiting for product! It said this until  dec 21 when the tracking info disappeared. Wrote emails and got very little response from pupsocks.If I could give this company negative stars I would. Should have read reviews first."
PupSocks,2020-12-28T23:51:16Z,2,I have not received a delivery as of today
PupSocks,2020-12-28T23:48:39Z,1,Ordered a month before Christmas and still have not received them. Sent multiple emails and now got an email that says I ordered December 26th is bad print quality. So 3 days after Christmas and still have no idea where my product is.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T23:48:16Z,3,Disappointed that the pictures in all 3 sets of socks were not as clear as you advertised
PupSocks,2020-12-28T23:47:01Z,5,"This was the best gift ever for my son!!! He loves his new socks, & tells everybody about his pup!! They are awesome!! Thank you for a great gift!!"
PupSocks,2020-12-28T23:46:46Z,3,"The socks were pretty cute. The issues are: the fabric is stiff, the proof didn’t come until after the socks came and the size runs small without another size for women.  I’m glad she liked them but hopefully they won’t end up as a cat toy. :/"
PupSocks,2020-12-28T23:45:31Z,1,I received socks with the wrong dog on them. I sent four emails because this was the only contact info given and every email said it could not be delivered so I never received the correct socks or a refund.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T23:37:53Z,5,My daughter was very happy with her Christmas present and completely surprised to find her dog on socks. This is a great gift idea and I highly recommend for anyone seeking a unique gift idea.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T23:35:21Z,3,Cool idea but the quality could be so much better.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T23:32:47Z,1,Ordered 11/30. Still no product and no communication since 12/16. Should have paid more attention to the reviews.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T23:30:01Z,1,"Ordered a pair of socks with my friends dog on them for Christmas, and you sent me socks with a random mans face on them. Didn’t hear from customer service for almost a full week."
PupSocks,2020-12-28T23:28:46Z,5,Pictures were clear and recognizable :-)
PupSocks,2020-12-28T23:26:53Z,5,"This was an awesome gift. My best friend's senior dog has been having some health issues and she was close to euthanasia last month. Dog pulled through, but I wanted to get her something useful but also memorable - a blanket with her pup's face sounded perfect! I was unsure how the image would turn out (the photo I had wasn't awesome) but it looked great! Shipping took a bit longer than I initially expected but since I ordered on Black Friday I assume it was due to high demand and already extended shipping times. Well worth the wait and my friend and her dog loved it!"
PupSocks,2020-12-28T23:24:27Z,5,"OMG!!!  When I got the blanket I ordered for my daughter I was so excited.  It was very soft, large and the pictures were perfect!!!  Then come to find out my boyfriend also got me one with our two dogs!!!  Happiest Christmas I've had in a long time!!!  Thank you so much!!!"
PupSocks,2020-12-28T23:18:09Z,1,"Ordered in November, I have received nothing and customer service doesn’t respond. I was foolish and paid via PayPal. I want a refund."
PupSocks,2020-12-28T23:15:50Z,5,"Even though I have not received my socks that were ordered over a month ago, I appreciate how PupSocks is handling the situation. They sent me a mock up of the socks so I could send it to the recipient at Christmas. We had a good laugh at the excellent work and I can appreciate the monumental effort it took to do that during this trying time. I was also advised that it’s an issue with USPS which is totally understandable under the circumstances. I will be patient and I will definitely use PupSocks again."
PupSocks,2020-12-28T23:14:18Z,1,"I ordered socks that were supposed to have two different faces printed on them, my order summary even shows the two images that were to be used. When they arrived, they had only printed one of the faces on the socks.I messaged PupSocks upon receiving the incorrect order but have not heard back since. I messaged a second time two weeks after the first message but still no reply. It’s been almost a month and I have yet to hear back about correcting my order or receiving any type of refund."
PupSocks,2020-12-28T23:12:53Z,4,The socks came out very cute. The material is a bit shiny. The fit is decent and there is good elasticity to the tops. Overall really good product. Thank you
PupSocks,2020-12-28T23:09:20Z,1,This place is a scam!!! Do NOT order from them!!!!  I placed my order on 11/30 and still have not received my item. I have filed a dispute with my CC company. Check out the Facebook page called Pup Socks Pup Scam.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T23:07:56Z,5,"These blankets are wonderful!  The pictures are clear and the material soooo soft.  We got one for each boy, and they love them!"
PupSocks,2020-12-28T23:05:56Z,2,Got these for a Christmas present.  Placed my order Nov 30.  And still haven’t received them.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T23:05:15Z,1,"I purchased 5 pairs of socks for my children for Christmas.  The material the socks were made of was awful, the socks themselves were more like a tube not a sock.  They did not fit anyone.  The image of my dog was awful, it made her look like a demon.I would never purchase your socks again nor recommend them to anyone.So disappointed and a waste of money."
PupSocks,2020-12-28T23:02:51Z,3,"Overall, fairly good quality socks and print.  However, given they are all custom, there's really no round of designer feedback or chance to point out changes.  I've ordered other custom products where this is actually automated on the website.  Seems like they are early in development.  But overall, still came out pretty good."
PupSocks,2020-12-28T22:59:36Z,4,The pictures on the socks are so cute and the recipients loved their gift! I wish the quality of the socks was better!
PupSocks,2020-12-28T22:57:14Z,4,"The socks were great. They accurately got 2/3 puppies exactly the way I wanted. The other was clear which puppy, but I guess I should have picked a different picture because it looked awkward on the mask."
PupSocks,2020-12-28T22:53:48Z,1,Placed my order on Nov 29 and still have not received it as of December 28. Completely too late now as it was intended to be a Christmas gift
PupSocks,2020-12-28T22:52:38Z,2,Took for ever to process the order
PupSocks,2020-12-28T22:52:11Z,1,"Like many others here, my order has not arrived even though the fedex label was printed over three weeks ago - when I email for support the CEO sent a generic out of office email saying they are overwhelmed and it is USPS's fault - funny, I ordered 2 day air via Fedex. Emailed multiple times, requesting refund and still no response. Horrible service."
PupSocks,2020-12-28T22:50:57Z,1,I have not received my order or any response to my emails to customer service.this is very disappointing
PupSocks,2020-12-28T22:46:22Z,5,"They're perfect!!!  The quality, the picture, the order process...everything was perfect. And my daughter won't take them off! Thank you!"
PupSocks,2020-12-28T22:42:59Z,5,Adorable socks
PupSocks,2020-12-28T22:41:13Z,1,"Still haven’t received my order, and I placed it in November. I understand that once the package is in USPS hands, it’s out of their control, however, I truly think the company should be better prepared for quicker production during the holidays. Every other small business order I made this season arrived on time. It has now been a month... I was embarrassed to tell the receiver I had no gift for her..."
PupSocks,2020-12-28T22:36:59Z,5,"I got a pair of PupSocks for my niece, she loved them!! I actually felt bad because she said out of all the gifts she got, these were her favorite! They were definitely worth it!"
PupSocks,2020-12-28T22:30:13Z,1,I haven’t received the order yet.It didn’t come in time for Christmas
PupSocks,2020-12-28T22:28:56Z,4,"the socks were very cute.  Unfortunately they arrived after christmas, I was really dissapointed with that.  I also feel the price was a little high, especially since I ordered them so far in advance hoping to get them here before christmas."
PupSocks,2020-12-28T22:27:34Z,1,I ordered these a month ago for a Christmas gift and have yet to receive them.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T22:26:25Z,5,This was exactly what I wanted and this socks were WONDERFUL. a true 5 star product.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T22:26:05Z,5,"I bought this for my girlfriend for Christmas, and she absolutely loves it. It is very warm and they did a great job with the pictures. The only thing that surprised me was that the pictures were much larger than I anticipated. The girlfriend didn't know any different, so that's all that matters."
PupSocks,2020-12-28T22:25:24Z,1,Socks fit terrible.  Do not buy
PupSocks,2020-12-28T22:23:58Z,5,Beautifully and perfectly done!
PupSocks,2020-12-28T22:22:50Z,1,Half of my order was incorrect & the socks were not the correct size.  I sent an email about an exchange but have had no response.  I would not recommend this product.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T22:19:04Z,5,"Thank you for a great product, our son loved them!"
PupSocks,2020-12-28T22:16:15Z,5,My daughter was thrilled to receive socks with the adorable face of her dog.  Great job.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T22:14:51Z,5,Absolutely love the print! Came out even more adorable than I anticipated!
PupSocks,2020-12-28T22:13:57Z,5,"Love, love the socks!  And everyone that saw them thought they were fantastic and could recognize my pups!"
PupSocks,2020-12-28T22:13:36Z,1,Ordered these for a Christmas on Cyber Monday. Christmas has come and gone and no sign of the socks. They’re trying to blame it on USPS but I have documentation showing they didn’t ship until WEEKS after we ordered.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T22:13:19Z,5,My sister loved the mask I got her with her doggie on it! Thank you!
PupSocks,2020-12-28T22:10:57Z,1,Still waiting for my order... been about a month or so
PupSocks,2020-12-28T22:10:55Z,5,Ordered these as a Christmas gift. Picture was transferred perfectly. High quality product. Would absolutely buy again.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T22:09:53Z,1,"Ordered Nov. 29th 2020Pre-Shipment label created Dec.11th 2020 1:57pm included USPS tracking number.PupSocks has not provided item to USPS for shipping. USPS states awaiting item. Dec. 28th 2020 still no delivery and USPS states awaiting item.Previous inquiry fell on ""deaf ears"".PupSocks now ""passing the buck"" and blaming USPS."
PupSocks,2020-12-28T22:09:41Z,4,"My order arrived after Christmas, but I understand that was not necessarily their fault. Blanket looks great, and is a very nice size."
PupSocks,2020-12-28T22:07:50Z,1,Ordered one month in advance and did not receive until after Christmas. Quality of items was lower than expected and overpriced.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T22:05:32Z,1,Never received my order. Very disappointed.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T22:04:17Z,2,The printing quality was great. The sock quality is horrible. Snap and feel of fabrics are not good.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T21:58:08Z,5,Love these socks. Best gift ever for my son
PupSocks,2020-12-28T21:53:46Z,4,Happy with the quality and design. Only complaint was that it took over a month to arrive and did not arrive for Christmas.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T21:53:28Z,1,"Ordered two pair of socks, billed for two pair, only received one pair.  Sent numerous emails, but with no response.  Stay away."
PupSocks,2020-12-28T21:52:36Z,3,"The image of the suck was great but the socks were very thin and wide. They weren't true to size, they also were not very stretchy."
PupSocks,2020-12-28T21:52:33Z,5,I got a pair for my husband and my son-in-law.  They both loved them and we all got a good laugh.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T21:49:33Z,5,I was skeptical about the quality but I couldn’t be happier!
PupSocks,2020-12-28T21:48:50Z,4,Would’ve been a five if I even got them.. LOL I wanted them for Christmas.. and still haven’t got them. I’m aware it’s probably because of covid and holidays but they at least attempted to email out a picture of my socks so I could show them to my girlfriend for Christmas!
PupSocks,2020-12-28T21:47:55Z,1,"I ordered at the end of November and still havent received my order. It was marked as shipped with a tracking number, but the order never actually shipped"
PupSocks,2020-12-28T21:44:11Z,5,I ordered two blankets for my sons for Christmas and they love them. The pictures look just like our precious pup.  A nice touch was receiving my items on Christmas Eve when I lost all hope with USPS.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T21:40:38Z,5,"Great socks, so funny seeing our dogs on them, who would've thought giving socks for xmas wouldn'tget me in trouble"
PupSocks,2020-12-28T21:40:24Z,5,Could not be more pleased. Had a blanket and socks made for my daughter for Christmas with our pups faces in them.  She is in love!  Blanket is super soft.  Production and shipping time was fast.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T21:39:40Z,5,Socks looked great.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T21:39:36Z,5,They came on time & look awesome. My dad loves them and they fit great (got the biggest size because he is a 13 in shoes).
PupSocks,2020-12-28T21:35:57Z,5,"great socks...my friend really loved them...I wanted to surprise her for Christmas...and she was!!...my problem is I committed a mistake all men make...hey, we’re guys, right?  I bought the wrong size...MY MISTAKE...NOT PUP SOCKS...I want to be clear on that....so I am going to reorder a bigger size....Thank you, Pup Socks...you rock!!!"
PupSocks,2020-12-28T21:35:53Z,1,"I ordered socks for a gift. They arrived later than expected and the entire order was incorrect (color of socks & photo were wrong). I have tried to reach customer service several times and was told that due to high demands, someone would connect with me within 72 hours. It’s now been over a week and still no response or resolution. I ordered last year and that order was slightly wrong as well (wrong color). After a disappointing second chance, I would not recommend this company."
PupSocks,2020-12-28T21:35:21Z,4,"The socks were good quality, but receiving a tube sock was a bit disappointing. It took over 3 weeks to ship, but I presume that it was due to COVID and the fact that it was ordered around the holidays."
PupSocks,2020-12-28T21:27:11Z,5,perfect!! got as gifts & were a big hit... had to order one for myself too! love it!! new favorite mask!! 💜💜💜💜
PupSocks,2020-12-28T21:25:13Z,5,"As expected, made a great gift"
PupSocks,2020-12-28T21:21:27Z,1,Never received them!
PupSocks,2020-12-28T21:19:58Z,5,My granddaughter is 12 and was very excited that her dog was actually on her socks.  Great job!!
PupSocks,2020-12-28T21:19:56Z,1,"Still have not received my order. Order was placed in November and shipped December 14th. There has been no update on the tracking in over 10 days, so I don’t know when or if I will actually receive what was ordered. Will be happy to update this review when I can actually rate the product"
PupSocks,2020-12-28T21:19:33Z,1,Ordered Nov 30. Never got my item for Christmas and after dec 14 they no longer responded to messages. Worthless company who could care less about their customers
PupSocks,2020-12-28T21:18:21Z,3,I paid for gift wrapping and that service wasn't rendered. I sent in several messages to Pupsocks asking for my refund for the gift wrapping and never heard back from anyone. I will use another company next time and do not recommend this one.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T21:18:13Z,4,"I technically gave these socks a 4-star rating because I noticed the company only displays 4- and 5-star reviews on their website.  My actual rating is around 2-stars.The images on the socks are great, however the socks themselves are very ill-fitting.  Ordered the proper size medium for my husband who is a size 9.5-10 show, but socks are very boxy.  They do not have a traditional sock shape and are very large in the toes, don't stay up on his calves, and baggy around the heel.  Cute item, but unfortunately cannot be worn without bunching and falling down."
PupSocks,2020-12-28T21:14:55Z,4,Very happy with my purchase! Socks looked great! My only issue was it took longer than expected for delivery. I would change your lead time based upon holidays and busy seasons to reflect a more accurate time frame.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T21:11:36Z,4,"They looked great. The only issue was one of the photos I sent turned out to be too dark. The product was great and the problem was my fault, but it would have been nice if the designer reached out and said, ""Hey, this photo is a little dark and might not show up well.""  Again, my fault, but something to consider. Thanks!"
PupSocks,2020-12-28T21:08:59Z,1,"My daughter was so excited to order a pair of pup socks for her daddy for Christmas. Unfortunately, when they arrived we were a bit disappointed by the material of the socks and the coloring. It makes sense that it is a different type of material for printing the animal on, but honestly we did not think of that before purchasing. Our dog is black and white, but the image of him looks more brown on the socks. Since we could not return them, we went ahead and gave them as a gift, but the socks ended up being too tight to wear."
PupSocks,2020-12-28T21:05:11Z,1,"So late, terrible customer service. No response to my emails. No updates on delivery. Order from a different company."
PupSocks,2020-12-28T21:01:38Z,5,The joy on the kid's face when she opened her PupSocks Christmas gift was EVERYTHING!!
PupSocks,2020-12-28T20:51:39Z,5,"The pup socks I bought for my brother and his girlfriend were a hit!  They came out so incredibly cute, they loved them and so did the rest of our family!  My only minor issue was that they never sent a proof image of the socks before they were delivered, oddly they sent it a few days after we already received the socks - but it didn't really matter because they came out perfect!  The quality of the sock isn't the best (thin/poly feeling), but they're so cute it doesn't even matter!"
PupSocks,2020-12-28T20:51:16Z,1,"Ordered on 11/28 and received confirmation for 8-10 business days - it is now 12/28 and my order still shows ""in transit"" as it has since the day it was supposed to arrive. The socks were ""supposedly"" mailed on 12/10 but had an arrival date of 12/18; they must have been sent by carrier pigeon! And, somewhere before the 18th that bird unfortunately must have been hit by an airplane. 10 days after what was already an excessive timeframe for delivery, I believe there's a pair of socks in a dead bird's mouth, on the ground, somewhere between Atlanta and Phoenix! Poor bird!!!I tried to reset my password so I could reach out to someone concerning the issue ... and the website wouldn't allow me to do that??? But I was sent a picture of my order via e-mail the day before Christmas. YAY!Maybe I can print 2 copies and tape them onto different socks, wrap them up and have the person I was giving them to open that as a ""New Years"" gift. What a treat that will be for them ... I'm SO excited!Pretty poor overall experience - but at least I feed a dog; provided the food made it to them?!?"
PupSocks,2020-12-28T20:50:08Z,1,I ordered my pup socks on November 28 and never did I dream that a month later I still would not have them. I was most excited about this present to give to my young kids and all I could do was show them a picture. Totally lame. I have lost confidence in the company; I am not even sure they will arrive.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T20:49:08Z,1,"so far I still don't have my order (I placed it on Black Friday and am still waiting).  I had to send two follow up emails asking about the delay before I got someone to respond back to me - as it was promised before Christmas.  They offered to give me 20% because of the delay but now 12 days later, I still have not received my discount or the socks.  Spending $25 for one pair of sock won't be something I do again."
PupSocks,2020-12-28T20:46:26Z,5,"Great job following my instructions, arrived on time. Thank you!"
PupSocks,2020-12-28T20:45:12Z,5,This is the second time I've ordered.  The socks are well made and the quality of the photo is surprisingly good!  Highly recommend.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T20:43:15Z,1,Haven't received my order when I ordered a month ago. Scam.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T20:42:12Z,1,The communication of this company is absolutely horrible. I have a huge disdain for this website. I had sent THREE different emails in regards to changing my shipping address and these people still managed to send my package to the wrong place. PURE INCOMPETENCE. This was a gift for my mother whose dog is 13 and dying of cancer. HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T20:41:48Z,5,Very interesting concept and came in time for Christmas - Will probably do it again next year!Happy New Year
PupSocks,2020-12-28T20:40:31Z,1,I ordered at the beginning of November and still haven’t gotten it yet so.....
PupSocks,2020-12-28T20:40:07Z,1,"First,They never answer back or even help you on a problem you could have on the package"
PupSocks,2020-12-28T20:38:32Z,1,"My order took 25 days to arrive and missed the occasion, I bought it for my wife's birthday. Tracking number never worked until it was actually here. Then when she opened it, it is someone else's dog on the overpriced blanket. I wish I had seen all the bad reviews before I placed this order."
PupSocks,2020-12-28T20:38:31Z,5,What a unique gift idea!  Highly recommend PupSocks!
PupSocks,2020-12-28T20:38:20Z,3,"Ordered a custom 4 kitty blanket on Nov 30th. After a few days (later than promised on the website) the order shipped. Or rather shipping label created. Then it sat for over two weeks. I don't know if the fault was Pupsocks or the USPS, but it finally did arrive.... after Christmas! I do know that my messages to Pupsocks about it went unanswered. As for the blanket, 3 of the 4 kitty pics turned out great, the other one they crudely cut out and took are half an ear and lopsided his head! Wife was very happy with it, which is what mattered I guess. Overall, the production time was quick as promised, the quality was pretty good,and the shipping was a total fail."
PupSocks,2020-12-28T20:35:03Z,1,"These socks are not made to fit a human foot.  The toe end of the sock is ridiculously wide.  If we were descendants of Big Foot, these might work.  Alas, we are not.  After reading some other reviews, I highly doubt I'll receive a refund on this poorly made product.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.  I just flushed $100 down the toilet."
PupSocks,2020-12-28T20:32:55Z,1,"As a first time customer, I was very upset to receive a dirty product. As I opened my package (which was for a Christmas gift) I was so disappointed to see both the front and the back of the socks dirty. They had huge marks and I was even more disappointed to not have been contacted by their customer service team by now. I have emailed twice, yet still get no response back. All in all, hope I can get a response back soon and hope they can TRIPLE check their products next time."
PupSocks,2020-12-28T20:25:59Z,2,"For the price of the socks (we ordered 3 pair), we were not impressed with the sock shape and quality. They are not form fitting to feet and are extra big despite the size guide. The picture quality is good though."
PupSocks,2020-12-28T20:24:20Z,1,"HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE.  I didn't think to check their ratings before ordering as their site looked legit and the product looked pretty cool  The ordering process was simple and they communicated reasonably well up until the ship date.  The problem is that they didn't actually ship the product when they said they did.  They created a shipping label for it, but USPS didn't actually receive it until a couple weeks later.  Their customer service said they couldn't do anything about it until 7 days after the shipping date and refused to acknowledge the fact that USPS never received it.  Then, they completely stopped responding to my chats and emails.  They clearly have a deceitful practice in how they deal with customers.  It seems to me that they couldn't keep up with demand and deliverables in time for christmas and just used poor communication and blatant lies to continue to get orders.  I filed a dispute with my credit card company - having given them several opportunities to respond to me first.  They never did so I got my money back that way."
PupSocks,2020-12-28T20:17:58Z,5,The socks were perfect.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T20:16:18Z,4,Pictures were good but masks were smaller than expected and socks were not comfortable to wear
PupSocks,2020-12-28T20:12:10Z,1,I placed my order at the end of November thinking it was plenty of time to get by Christmas since you guys advertise quick shipping. A label was created to ship over a week later so again thought plenty of time...well Christmas has come and gone and I still do not have my order. And nobody has replied to my TWO emails to customer service inquiring about my order.  Those emails were a week ago. Very poor customer service.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T20:09:53Z,3,"I ordered my socks in November, it took a month to get them. the socks are very thick and made from a very unusual material. I received an email regarding the reason for the late arrival after reaching out to see where me order was. The responds was fair,  but when I asked how to get my refund  no more information has been given."
PupSocks,2020-12-28T20:08:27Z,1,"I ordered my socks on no. 7th - was told they would arrive before Christmas, I’m still waiting on them. This is my first time ordering pup socks. So far, I have not been pleased. No communication with regards to an ETA. The link the track my order doesn’t seem to work. Currently, not a happy customer."
PupSocks,2020-12-28T20:08:02Z,5,"These socks are exactly what I was looking for!  The digital cutouts of the dogs' faces and ears were perfect, and I was especially impressed given the pictures I sent.  The faces were a bit narrow on the socks so that when they're on feet, the faces are exactly the right proportion. The socks are soft and well-made.  Delivery was slow but this wasn't their fault, and their response was incredibly kind and professional. I would/ will work with this company again with no hesitation."
PupSocks,2020-12-28T20:06:35Z,1,"Absolutely horrible experience. My first order got lost. Then they placed a replacement order on December 1st, and promised on multiple occasions it would be received by Christmas. It is now December 28th and I still don’t have my order. Never ordering from here again after this."
PupSocks,2020-12-28T20:04:52Z,5,I had the socks made for my niece with the picture of her dog.  She absolutely loved them!!  They turned out great!
PupSocks,2020-12-28T20:03:49Z,2,"I made an order for Christmas nearly a month in advance on November 30th. My product went “in production” about a week later and stayed that status until it shipped just a day or two before Christmas. I never received communication that it would be that late and when I did contact them to see when I could expect it, I first did not get a response at all and I waited past the amount of time their automatic email told me I could expect a response. Only after contacting them a second time did I get an email and several more after, all saying that the mail system is very much delayed and they can’t control that. I understand things being delayed more than normal this year, however this was not the mail systems fault. They had one pair of socks I ordered “in production” for weeks. I would have been more understanding had they just admitted to taking on too many orders and apologizing for not communicating long delays with their customers. Instead they tried to point the finger at someone else. When the socks finally did arrive after Christmas, they were very large for my 10 year old daughter who wears a size 3. I ordered the youth size (for kids sized 1-5). The sizing was way off. The print of our pet was very well done...but after all, I wouldn’t pay that again for this product."
PupSocks,2020-12-28T20:00:53Z,4,"the masks i ordered were adorable my friends loved them each with their dog photos on the maskmy only complaint is          re: customer service   no phone number to call so you must email           which should not be an issue : however  they reply to your email           3-4 days after you send it  this is unacceptable   should not happen           ** especially if you  have a quick question , and want to place              your order  .. no reply for several days!!"
PupSocks,2020-12-28T19:54:49Z,1,"I ordered socks and blankets on November 17th.  My credit card was promptly charged.  Since then, I have emailed a dozen or more times.  The anonymous CEO sent me a note (generic) blaming the issue on the United States Postal Service.  Which, is very interesting given that my product has neither been produced or shipped.  I want a full refund, and I get nothing from them.  Order number 2372261.  Their customer service / responsiveness is absolutely awful."
PupSocks,2020-12-28T19:53:03Z,1,"My order came in almost a month after placing it. When I finally received my package, it wasn’t even what I had ordered. Support team is now taking a very long time to help me."
PupSocks,2020-12-28T19:52:49Z,5,My son loved these socks with pictures of his beloved best buddy! The socks are lightweight and soft. He said the will be perfect to wear with his ski boots.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T19:47:52Z,5,So cute and looks exactly like my dog!!  Downside it just took a month to get it
PupSocks,2020-12-28T19:41:46Z,1,No phone number listed for customer service. No response on an update on my order for 10 days. Reported a dispute against this company for being fraudulent.  Will never purchase from PupSocks again.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T19:32:19Z,5,Great product! Makes the perfect gift for any animal lover.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T19:29:55Z,1,Still waiting to hear from this company that sent me the wrong order! Terrible service will not EVER purchase again from this company
PupSocks,2020-12-28T19:27:50Z,5,"The socks came so quickly and they turned out so cute! I got them for my boyfriend for Christmas, featuring pictures of his cat, and he loved them!"
PupSocks,2020-12-28T19:26:14Z,5,"I ordered PupSocks as a gift for my nephew.  He loves it!  The pup logo looks exactly like his dog Brody, and it's a very crisp image.  I love the vibrant color of the socks too!  I even placed another order for 3 more pairs of PupSocks after I received it because I was impressed with the quality and uniqueness of the item.  I highly recommend PupSocks to everyone!"
PupSocks,2020-12-28T19:25:17Z,1,"Where to begin, I placed my order on 11/30/2020, after the initial 10 day I sent an email asking about my order, which I was told someone would get in touch with me within 24 hrs. Three days later and three more emails I finally received correspondence saying they were behind but my order would be sent out “Priority” so as to receive it be Christmas. My order is due to be delivered on 12/29/2020, a far cry from the 5-7 business days stated on the website.  I would not recommend them at all, customer service is severely lacking with this company."
PupSocks,2020-12-28T19:23:32Z,1,"I ordered socks for my son and a mask for my daughter in law for Christmas on November 30th. I received an email on December 11th that they shipped. The tracking notification states the post office hasn't received the order yet. It's December 28th and still no sign of the items. Pupbox is blaming COVID and USPS. However, I've received all the other gifts I ordered this holiday season from every other vendor."
PupSocks,2020-12-28T19:13:40Z,4,"The design is great and the personal pet photos always please! However, the fit is not great. It is too large around the toe area and tight on the calf. I wish they were cozier material too, but I know they have to be screen-printed."
PupSocks,2020-12-28T19:09:16Z,2,"After over a month of waiting and a few emails to the company (which I heard nothing from), I received my socks and was a bit shocked by the quality. The pictures that I sent them were good and that part of the production came out as expected. The sock itself is not the best material and it had no ending to the top of the sock such as a rib area or anything. I just thought they were poorly made. I won’t be doing that again with socks.  This really makes me dislike online shopping since I can’t see and touch what I’m purchasing."
PupSocks,2020-12-28T19:07:10Z,5,LOVE THESE PUP SOCKS! My little Yorkie “gave” these to my Fiancé for Christmas and they were an absolute hit! Thank you! The material is not what i was expecting but still a great quality and the pic of our pup came out wonderful. Lots of laughs/smiles because of this gift.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T19:00:36Z,1,"It has taken over a month to receive my order. Pupsocks says USPS is to blame but my tracking information only says a label has been created since December 11th and they are still awaiting my package. They sent me a mock up of my mask with the wrong color and with only one cat on it, when I paid extra for two cats. I wanted to order more stuff as gifts but I will never order from Pupsocks again."
PupSocks,2020-12-28T18:58:17Z,1,"I placed an order for two blankets on November 30, expecting to have delivery well before Christmas. The order has yet to be delivered as I am writing this review on December 28. Several checks were made on the order and I even sent a message asking for an update on the order. Your website stated that a response would be sent within 72 hours (longer due to increased demand). I have yet to receive any feedback on my message. I finally received an e-mail on December 22 stating that my order had shipped. Continues checks on the USPS on the tracking number shows that only the shipping label has been printed. Your poor performance has raised the question of whether or not I will ever order from you again. I am a returning customer, but your performance on this order was dismal."
PupSocks,2020-12-28T18:55:43Z,1,"Didn’t crop picture how I asked. I had a cute photo and they made it awful.  My daughter didn’t even recognize it as her cat on Christmas because they made it no longer look like him. I ordered youth socks and they look so large and I don’t see how these will ever fit for another 10 years. The shape is terrible, too."
PupSocks,2020-12-28T18:54:40Z,1,"Lets see, 2 orders did not ship for Christmas although I had them ordered 4 weeks ahead. They did not read the instructions I had on the pictures and I got entirely different than what I had hoped, and finally I thought the sock material was cheap."
PupSocks,2020-12-28T18:53:46Z,1,I ordered the socks on November 30th.  I still don't have them on December 28th.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T18:52:43Z,1,"Horribly synthetic. And the photos were badly cropped around the animals’ faces. And they arrived after Christmas. Know that’s beyond your control but in all, considering how expensive they were as well, I’d advise people not to bother and spend your money more wisely."
PupSocks,2020-12-28T18:51:18Z,5,"Great quality, exactly what I was looking for, clear images & really cute!"
PupSocks,2020-12-28T18:49:58Z,1,I ordered a month before Christmas and it came two weeks after Christmas.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T18:49:37Z,5,My friend loved the socks.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T18:47:14Z,1,"I have not even received my item, ordered a month ago, and you don’t have the decency to even acknowledge my customer service requests sent over multiple platforms. I’m floored by your business practices and have contacted my credit card company to dispute the charge."
PupSocks,2020-12-28T18:45:46Z,1,I wish I could review my product but I ordered it a month ago for Christmas and it has yet to arrive. I also have yet to hear back from a customer service agent to inform me of the matter. I understand times are difficult right now but taking time to communicate with your customers is free and covid can’t get in the way of an email. Unfortunately I can’t give a great review because at this point I’ve just been robbed almost $200 with no one to talk to about it.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T18:45:09Z,5,Ordered 4 pairs and that came out prefect! gGreat Job!
PupSocks,2020-12-28T18:42:00Z,1,"I never received my order!!! Unfortunatly, it was for a christmas gift. I am really disapointed!!!... :("
PupSocks,2020-12-28T18:40:02Z,3,"First, the dog photos came out perfectly. The sock fabric was a little odd but probably due to the picture process. What was most disappointing however was the fact that the masks are too small for an adult. To tell the truth I was ready to order 10 more until I saw the size. So disappointing. An inch or a little over an inch more of fabric both ways would have worked. Current size is not usable because it won’t offer even minimal protection. Customer service regarding order status questions was great."
PupSocks,2020-12-28T18:39:11Z,3,"Quality of graphic was fantastic, but the masks I ordered were just too small. I got them for my mom and sis who are both small people and they love them but have to wear them over their regular masks to get safe coverage. If the masks were bigger I would have given four or five stars."
PupSocks,2020-12-28T18:28:27Z,2,Made two orders on the same day. The one I made later in the day arrived first. The one I made first has still not arrived...4 weeks later.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T18:28:25Z,5,I am so very impressed with my PupSocks!! They came out beautifully and Inwill be ordering another pair very soon!
PupSocks,2020-12-28T18:27:24Z,1,We placed the order on Nov 30 and are still waiting on delivery. We understand that the postal service is experiencing delays but our order wasn’t even processed for two weeks. This was an anticipated Christmas gift that won’t be now because it is so late arriving. We are VERY disappointed in the service and likely will not order again.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T18:26:42Z,1,I bought a pair of socks in November and didn't get them until days before Christmas and I understand due to covid. But then I open the package and they aren't even what I ordered. I ordered pink socks with a huskys face I sent in on them and I got green socks with a cat on them. So I sent an email letting them know what happened and they haven't even responded with a real answer. I'm not going to give someone a Christmas gift in February when it finally gets here and I'd rather have my money back considering I wasn't given the item I paid for yet I've been put off with generic auto reply emails and im doubtful I'll ever get my money back.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T18:23:51Z,1,I ordered 10 pairs of socks and one mask on November 29th. I was super excited to have something unique for everyone in my family. It is December 28th and I still don’t have my order. I am very disappointed in this company’s inability to provide the promised product in the time they promised. They were very quick to charge my credit card however!!
PupSocks,2020-12-28T18:21:34Z,5,Quick and perfect!
PupSocks,2020-12-28T18:18:28Z,2,The image was not cropped as asked. Never gave beyond an auto response to my email. Very disappointed along with the quality of the socks. Would not recommend this business.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T18:17:31Z,2,"The socks are ok. They are the tube type. They have no shape and therefore are not very.  comfortable. The delivery was awful. I ordered 5 weeks  before Xmas and didn’t receive until the 28th. I understand it’s busy during holiday season, but thats unreal. Generally disappointed but hey it’s just a novelty gift anyway"
PupSocks,2020-12-28T18:17:07Z,5,I ordered these for Christmas presents for my son and my son-in-law. They both loved them and put them on right away. It’s so hard to come up with original gift ideas that are actually useful. These were perfect!
PupSocks,2020-12-28T18:15:16Z,1,"Your joking, right?! I haven’t even received my order, that was placed in November! I will NEVER order or recommend your company again! Horrible!"
PupSocks,2020-12-28T18:13:44Z,1,"Terrible company. Terrible customer service. Do not order from them.Ordered socks end of November 2020. Received an email saying ""Congratulations. Your product has shipped."" on December 11, 2020. Looked at the tracking number and the USPS said the package was never received - meaning the company had not delivered the package to the USPS. Followed up twice but got canned responses. Turns out there's a Facebook group dedicated to this possibly being a scam.FB: Pupsocks or Pupscams"
PupSocks,2020-12-28T18:13:39Z,5,The socks and blanket I ordered turned out great! Exactly as advertised.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T18:13:01Z,5,"Ordered two pairs of socks, each with a different image and background. Was so blown away by how amazing they turned out! It was a gift for my partner and he was over the moon for them. Thank you guys so much! Highly recommend!"
PupSocks,2020-12-28T18:13:00Z,1,"This would be a zero star review, but they don’t exist. Do not purchase product from them. Use sockprints.com or another. The experience with pupsocks.com was a total disappointment. It has been 6 weeks since I ordered the product for a Christmas gift and I still haven’t received it. The gift was to be sent to an overseas address and when I received the confirmation email, the ‘ship to’ address did not appear correctly on the confirmation email. I wrote immediately to check and I was told all was well. After four weeks, the product still had not arrived at its destination. It was promised in 12-15 days and I gave some extra time because they use USPS and things are slow. On the 15th of December, I wrote to the customer service team to check in and was told that I should expect a response in 2-3 days since they were so busy. It took the Customer Service team ten days to reply to me and when they did reply on Christmas Day... they said the product is showing as lost by USPS. Not surprising with the address mix up I mentioned earlier. I asked for a full reimbursement They customer service team also referred me to the return policy which is, I guess, there attempt at holiday humor since I don’t have anything to return... I was told since I was cancelling the order they would keep a portion of the fee for customization. This isn't a cancellation due to any action on my part, rather due to issues on execution on their part. I shared this review with them before posting (made some minor modifications for clarity) and they did not reply or make any offer to address. Take your business elsewhere!!!"
PupSocks,2020-12-28T18:11:54Z,1,I ordered a pair of socks which were intended to be a Christmas present and still have not received them!
PupSocks,2020-12-28T18:10:27Z,4,The socks and service were great. But the picture was was cropped too much so that our cat was not instantly identifiable.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T18:08:48Z,5,Love love love our pupsocks!  Santa got them for our kids with their pets photos and they were one of the kids favorite gifts!
PupSocks,2020-12-28T18:03:27Z,5,"The images of the pups on the blanket and socks I ordered were great! Nice softness on the blanket, too!"
PupSocks,2020-12-28T18:01:28Z,1,"I placed my order when the website said I would h e by Christmas. As the week of Christmas came, no blanket. I emailed regarding my order and got a generic response but no info of when my order will arrive. Now, 3 days after Christmas, I still haven’t heard anything."
PupSocks,2020-12-28T18:00:49Z,1,Haven’t received my socks or any updates after a month; cannot get a response on the status of my order. Will not be ordering again
PupSocks,2020-12-28T18:00:19Z,1,Ordered a pair of Socks for a Christmas at thanksgiving. Did not come in time
PupSocks,2020-12-28T18:00:01Z,2,"These socks are cute, but that is it. They are not soft, they are really small, and the packaging was detached and damaged on of the socks in transport. You get all this and they are not inexpensive. I have contacted customer service 3 days ago and still have not heard anything back. Great idea, very poorly executed."
PupSocks,2020-12-28T17:56:42Z,5,These socks are great!  Fast shipping in time for Xmas and they look awesome!
PupSocks,2020-12-28T17:52:23Z,5,Gifted these socks this Xmas and the recipient was thrilled.  Great quality.  Was definitely worth the reaction.dje
PupSocks,2020-12-28T17:52:00Z,5,Pics turned out great. Digging the color. Good socks  as far as socks are concerned to boot!!
PupSocks,2020-12-28T17:51:20Z,1,I’ve sent 2 emails to PupSocks describing my dissatisfaction with my order I ordered socks with a picture of a cat I downloaded and received socks with a dog instead. Please refund or send the proper items ordered
PupSocks,2020-12-28T17:49:11Z,4,"They are nice but the material is not standard sock material; its like a compression sock rather than regular cotton or polyester socks.  I just wasn’t expecting that. Otherwise the appearance is great, and they were completed early (although they arrived the day after Christmas-not their fault). I’d buy again."
PupSocks,2020-12-28T17:46:02Z,5,My kids love the socks!  They are about to go to college and are excited to be able to take them with them in some way.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T17:45:22Z,5,"My stepson LOVED the socks we got him with a picture of both him and his dog, Zoe. Big hit!"
PupSocks,2020-12-28T17:45:08Z,3,I would prefer another color; I had a cat face.  The material is odd; too tight.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T17:44:36Z,5,I got a blanket for my daughter and she absolutely loves it!  It’s so cute and the pictures I sent turned out perfect on the blanket!
PupSocks,2020-12-28T17:44:26Z,1,"I ordered on November 21st, in plenty of time for Christmas and it's now December 28th.  I have emailed twice with absolutely no response.  I will be getting my money back through Amazon.  I read the reviews after and see that I am not the only one."
PupSocks,2020-12-28T17:43:41Z,1,Sent wrong socks!I have emailed and sent pictures as proof and have heard nothingWould not recommend
PupSocks,2020-12-28T17:43:39Z,1,I received my order but it was not my pet’s face on them.  I have sent three emails over the last 10 days but have not received a reply.  I did get an email with a mock up of my order so I could show that to my daughter on Christmas morning.  Apparently they thought that would make everything right.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T17:43:19Z,3,I received the socks and was happy with the graphics. The feel of the fabric is almost plastic in texture/feel. This was a Christmas gift for my adult son. He is a size men’s 10. He couldn’t even get the sock half way up his foot. Disappointed the socks can’t even be worn.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T17:41:35Z,5,"I ordered a mask with my cats face in it and it was perfect! The pictures on it are clear and exactly how the original was! The mask itself is very soft and fits perfectly. I’ve already ordered a blanket with my dog on it ! Cant wait to see that! Thank you pup socks , great job! I would highly recommend!"
PupSocks,2020-12-28T17:40:25Z,2,"The pup socks concept is great but the quality of the socks that is sent is poor. While I loved seeing the image of my pup on a pair of socks, it's pointless if the socks are of poor quality and poor fit. It defeats the purpose. Maybe start with a better material and a more customized fit rather than one size fits all. I probably will not order another pair nor recommend these because of the reasons stated above."
PupSocks,2020-12-28T17:40:17Z,1,"Ordered my pup socks 3 weeks ago - was told they would be here by Christmas, that was a LIE. Still waiting!!!!!!"
PupSocks,2020-12-28T17:40:12Z,5,My Cat's Face all over the socks!
PupSocks,2020-12-28T17:39:31Z,3,"The blanket I ordered was awesome but unfortunately the mask I ordered was way too small for an adult. They should tell you the sizes before ordering, if they even have different sizes? The mask was not the best quality for the price paid. Would definitely not order the mask again but I would order the blanket."
PupSocks,2020-12-28T17:39:30Z,5,Great gift!!!
PupSocks,2020-12-28T17:39:14Z,3,"The socks overall look really cute. The cutouts of the dog faces were very well done! A little annoyance is that there is a white line down the sides due to the pattern being printed flat front and back. Also, the socks are not the standard “L shape” so they bunch at the front of the ankle when worn and look odd when worn with shoes. Despite these issues, it was a cute little gift for my boyfriend and I’m glad I got it for him in the end."
PupSocks,2020-12-28T17:37:32Z,5,Great job with our boxer’s face!! My teenagers sons loved their stocking stuffer!
PupSocks,2020-12-28T17:37:05Z,3,Very cute but the material of the socks is a very cheap polyester. For that reason I wouldn’t order them again.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T17:36:12Z,1,I never received my item and never got a response from customer service even though I emailed multiple times.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T17:36:08Z,5,Daughters said best gift this year!
PupSocks,2020-12-28T17:35:50Z,1,I never got my order and no responses from my emails or refund.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T17:34:32Z,5,Excellent product and they were able to get both of my pets faces on the socks with no issue. Loved it. Also great customer service and communication. Highly recommended!
PupSocks,2020-12-28T17:33:21Z,5,Love them! Great idea for an animal lover.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T17:30:41Z,1,"This is for the PupSocks masks: They are extremely thin and flimsy and definitely need to be worn in conjunction with another mask. A real bummer for the price. Also came after Christmas, despite my having ordered them in early December."
PupSocks,2020-12-28T17:29:59Z,2,"The processing time for orders is sloooow, customer service takes 2 weeks to respond to inquiries about your order. I eventually got a refund for an order than never shipped but pretty poor customer service and processing time."
PupSocks,2020-12-28T17:28:22Z,3,Can't review because have not received anything
PupSocks,2020-12-28T17:28:19Z,1,"Ordered on November 30, it is December 28th and I still don’t have my order. Shipping issues aside, it should not have taken 3 weeks to ship the order to begin with."
PupSocks,2020-12-28T17:25:45Z,1,Never got here for Christmas
PupSocks,2020-12-28T17:24:43Z,1,"Order placed in November in hopes to receive before Christmas. As of today (Dec. 28th), I have not received the socks."
PupSocks,2020-12-28T17:21:51Z,2,"The socks are cut strangely. There is extra material around the front of the ankles that bunches up, unlike any socks I've ever had."
PupSocks,2020-12-28T17:21:48Z,1,"Ordered socks on 11/24/2020.  Still have not received them.  The order didn’t ship until 12/21 and is still pending acceptance in Atlanta.  Ie, the post office hasn’t received the package yet.  Pandemic or not this is poor quality service.  Will never order again but will share my dissatisfaction with all my social media friends"
PupSocks,2020-12-28T17:20:11Z,4,"Image on the socks turned out better than expected, but the material used in the socks is not the best."
PupSocks,2020-12-28T17:19:36Z,5,So excited to give the gift!
PupSocks,2020-12-28T17:17:59Z,5,My daughter loved her blanket I got her of all 4 of her dogs pictures on it!  It got delivered in a timely manner & product turned out good!
PupSocks,2020-12-28T17:15:34Z,1,I ordered a pair of socks 11/30 and still have NOT received them!
PupSocks,2020-12-28T17:14:25Z,5,Loved these socks! I ordered 7 different pairs for Christmas & they were amazing & loved by all! They were perfect & pure joy on the faces of the receivers!! Would definitely order again!!
PupSocks,2020-12-28T17:12:44Z,5,"Very happy with the quality of the socks, and a quick turnaround time too."
PupSocks,2020-12-28T17:11:34Z,5,"We ordered 2 pairs as a gift, and they were a huge hit!"
PupSocks,2020-12-28T17:11:32Z,5,These made awesome stocking stuffers for my family at Christmas!!
PupSocks,2020-12-28T17:11:04Z,1,Ordered completed early December. USPS has been awaiting shipment since December 11th. Hard to review a product I haven’t received.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T17:10:51Z,1,Has been one month since I ordered these socks and have heard nothing from PupSocks. Have emailed countless times to see the order status and never hear anything from them. Looking now to try and get a refund.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T17:09:57Z,2,Sock quality is poor.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T17:09:13Z,2,"Sooooo- it’s a local business and that’s good.  But dude, the quality is so bad.  The only thing high  quality about the socks is my dogs face.  I’m assuming printing a face on a sock requires a certain kind of material.  I’m a sock snob so I am hard to impress."
PupSocks,2020-12-28T17:08:57Z,3,Slow shipping and not great quality
PupSocks,2020-12-28T17:07:05Z,5,Quality product. Arrived fairly quickly.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T17:06:45Z,1,It’s been 6 weeks and I still don’t have the product.  I request two different pics on each product and the mock up after 6 weeks shows one on each
PupSocks,2020-12-28T17:06:34Z,5,"The order was placed almost two months ago still not delivered.   To be fair, they did say would run late, however I did not expect it to be so late.  It was a Christmas gift.  I do not know how it looks as I have not received it yet."
PupSocks,2020-12-28T17:05:56Z,3,Fabric is good quality and timing of order efficient. Disappointed by the resolution of the pic on the blanket and it isn’t the pic I asked for. I would have preferred a way to see the final product before ordering. I have sent a few emails to rectify this and haven’t heard back. I would love to order from you again if you can clear this up.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T17:05:17Z,1,"Ordered socks the day after thanksgiving.  Here it is 3 days after Christmas and still no socks.  Even worse, no communication from pop socks.   Incredibly disappointing"
PupSocks,2020-12-28T17:04:49Z,5,"I ordered these for my daughter for Christmas with two images of her cat, Gus.  I was worried they wouldn't get here in time as it took longer to ship than expected.  However, customer service was very responsive and we did receive them in time!  They were a big hit!  Thank you!"
PupSocks,2020-12-28T17:03:01Z,1,I ordered Black Friday hoping it would come by Christmas and I still have not received the product. Highly disappointed
PupSocks,2020-12-28T17:02:02Z,5,"I bought socks for my son and he loves them. They came out great feel nice and comfy, good quality."
PupSocks,2020-12-28T17:01:47Z,1,"Sorry but I ordered these for Christmas gifts back on Nov 20, and they’re still not even in my country.  Hard to give them a good rating when I don’t even have the product yet."
PupSocks,2020-12-28T17:00:54Z,1,I ordered my socks over 30 days ago and still have not received them.  I will definitely not be ordering anything from them in the future. Maybe I'll get my order by Christmas 2021?
PupSocks,2020-12-28T17:00:22Z,1,I ordered this for a Christmas gift. It took 3 weeks to receive my order and it was wrong. After 3 or 4 times of trying to reach somebody they finally replied back and said that they would send me a new order. Im still waiting...2 weeks later.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T17:00:22Z,3,"The socks are cute, but the quality of the material is subpar. It also took a long time to receive them."
PupSocks,2020-12-28T16:58:33Z,1,Love the photos but the socks are not wearable. They don’t stretch and can’t even get them over the foot.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T16:57:52Z,5,Great product - I do wish you had options for types of sock textures. I don't love the texture of the sock but the girls are so happy Lucy Lemon is now on their feet all the time!
PupSocks,2020-12-28T16:57:49Z,1,I never received my order and I sent you emails and even contacted you on Instagram and you never replied.Worst company ever.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T16:57:49Z,4,Excellent product and service!
PupSocks,2020-12-28T16:57:28Z,5,I am so happy with my purchase. I ordered custom socks for my sister in law with the faces of her two kittens and in her favorite color. They arrived very quickly and I was amazed at the quality of the work. The pictures were so clear and she was beyond thrilled on Christmas morning. Thank you!
PupSocks,2020-12-28T16:57:06Z,3,Delayed responses perpetuated delays In production and shipments
PupSocks,2020-12-28T16:57:01Z,5,"The ordering and photo uploading process worked well for me, I had basic instructions for the designer, and my socks arrived after two weeks.They were the right size, the colors and picture were perfect!Thanks for making a creative and personalized gift!"
PupSocks,2020-12-28T16:56:52Z,5,"Very happy with the mock up, it looks great."
PupSocks,2020-12-28T16:56:18Z,2,At the time that I was asked to do this review. I still haven't received the PupSocks. I ordered them on 11/30/2020 and the current date is 12/28/2020. I am very disappointed these aren't here for Christmas. This was ordered well in advance.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T16:55:16Z,5,So cute! I love them.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T16:54:38Z,2,The sock fabric is awful I purchased as a gift and I doubt they’ll be worn. But they’re fun socks and for a good cause
PupSocks,2020-12-28T16:53:55Z,1,Socks didn’t fit anyone that I got them for. Calf area too tight toe are too loose and boxy. Waiting to hear back from company for refund.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T16:53:38Z,1,Never got my blankets that I ordered after over a month of waiting. After doing some research on pupsocks it seems like I’m not the only one that’s in the same boat. They sent me a tracking number but the package was never received by USPS. Thanks for nothing pupsocks!
PupSocks,2020-12-28T16:51:42Z,5,"Very cute blanket! My son loved it.  The price was reasonable,  the shipping cost also reasonable and it got to us pretty quick.  Thank you!"
PupSocks,2020-12-28T16:50:56Z,2,The picture of our cat is great but the socks are poor quality and cannot be worn so can't give it a good review.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T16:49:46Z,1,I have not yet received my item
PupSocks,2020-12-28T16:49:23Z,1,"I placed my order over a month before Christmas and finally received my package the day before I was set to gift it and I open the package to see that what I received was not my order, not the dog or even the color socks I ordered.  I emailed customer service right away and have not received any response or a refund as of yet and it’s been a week.  I’m very disappointed and will not be ordering from them anymore."
PupSocks,2020-12-28T16:49:16Z,1,"I ordered a pair of socks on Nov. 20 and have yet to receive them (today is Dec.28).  I have emailed the company 6 times (there is no contact phone number) and only once received a reply telling me to contact their international shipping company.  When I did that, the shipping company said they never received my order - and also verified that pupsocks did not give me an actual tracking number to confirm that they sent anything to the shipping facility.  I have continued to email pupsocks hoping that they will provide reasonable customer service and give me a refund, but have never gotten any reply.  I should also say that last week I googled the company and discovered that the Better Business Bureau reported complaints from 43 states and several countries, all with similar issues as mine.  I would definitely recommend NOT to order from this site!"
PupSocks,2020-12-28T16:48:53Z,1,Ordered a Christmas gift on November 30th and paid for it. Its December 28th and still haven't received it. No customer support besides a system generated email that basically says they bit off more than they can chew.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T16:47:15Z,2,"The picture turned out well, but the sizing is a little off. I ordered the women’s size 4-8 for someone who wears a women’s size 7 and they are huge. The other problem is that I have received an e-mail advertisement every single day since I’ve ordered from this company. I’ve requested twice to be removed and they keep coming. Would recommend using a different company since there are many that do similar things"
PupSocks,2020-12-28T16:46:25Z,3,The design was perfect however the socks have zero stretch and are not overly comfortable.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T16:45:08Z,1,"I am still waiting on a Christmas gift I ordered November 27th, it is now December 28th. I have contacted customer service only to receive a generic very unsympathetic response. On Christmas Eve I received a mock up of my order to print off or show the recipient. The mock up had the wrong background color and looked so brutal I couldn’t show that to my sister ( who the gift is for). At this point I’m not even interested in getting it. I have already purchased her a different gift as I had to have a gift for my sister ON CHRISTMAS. Now, sometime in February I am going to give her the gift I wanted to get her. That is awkward. Thank goodness this isn’t an expensive gift and I didn’t waste too much money. But I liked the novelty idea of her pup on a mask and I was excited to give it to her. Way to mess up Christmas as I had to get a last min rushed replacement gift after thinking a long time ago I had an ice thoughtful gift coming. Your greed and accepting more orders than you can handle has lost you a lot of customers. I ordered socks from you last year, I am one of the many repeat customers whom you will not get back. This situation was not handled properly at all. Things happen, it is exceptional times, but the way you handle them either grows your reputation or ruins it.Edited to add: Wow. 20% off my next order. Thank you, but I personally will not be making any further purchases from you. It is laughable to think that you believe attempting to lure me into spending more money to get a special 20% off would be effective. Based on the reviews I have seen you have ruined many people’s Christmas including mine by not fulfilling their orders on time, leaving them to find a replacement at the last minute. This offer by no means makes up for anything at all. Thank you, but no thank you."
PupSocks,2020-12-28T16:42:16Z,1,HORRIBLE!!!  I ordered socks/blanket for my daughter's Christmas gift on NOV. 30th!!!  and I have yet to receive it on DEC 28th!!  Don't put all the blame on USPS either.  You all finished processing it on Dec.8th and created the shipping label on it Dec.9th however you all didn't bring it to USPS till Dec 19th!!  THen when you try to reach out to contact you all it is impossible and you get no response.  Last time I buy something here.  I should have read the other reviews before purchasing.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T16:41:33Z,5,"Fast shipping, super cute product! Love them"
PupSocks,2020-12-28T16:40:50Z,5,The photo we uploaded was clearly depicted on the socks.  Everyone was so happy with this original gift and the comfort of the socks.  A terrific and unique gift item!!
PupSocks,2020-12-28T16:35:38Z,1,"How do I begin? Placed my order on November 27th for 'guaranteed' delivery before Christmas. They only acknowledged the purchase on the 7th of December. Informed me that it shipped on the 9th. I checked on the product 4 days later only to find out it not only hadn't shipped, but the product hadn't even had a shipping label printed. As of the 16th, it was still in South Florida. Complained to PayPal for the idiocy of this company and Pupsocks immediately responded with a 40% off coupon for my next purchase. Fascinating how you wouldn't reply to a frustrated customer writing repeatedly for almost a month, but immediately sent a coupon when I complained to PayPal.BEWARE!! If they're not fraudulent, their practices are."
PupSocks,2020-12-28T16:35:19Z,5,Socks were a huge hit with my wife for Christmas...she actually got a little mushy when she saw her pup on them.  8 year old daughter was very jealous.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T16:34:25Z,1,"Wrong color socks and wrong dog (the stock-photo example dog) and customer service won’t answer any of my emails. (I know it’s a busy time of year, but I have read other reviews of people saying the same thing and it’s weird.) I hope that it gets corrected because I would love to support a company that gives back."
PupSocks,2020-12-28T16:33:29Z,5,These were definitely at hit!
PupSocks,2020-12-28T16:33:20Z,1,Never received it
PupSocks,2020-12-28T16:32:58Z,1,I ordered these early enough that you promised I would get it before Christmas....but I did not.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T16:31:47Z,5,This is my third time ordering from PupSocks and they have always exceeded expectations. My kids LOVE being able to show off their pets on these personalized socks. They have great customer service as well.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T16:31:02Z,1,I still have not received my order and am ready to cancel. I made order before thanksgiving and have received many “here it comes.”’
PupSocks,2020-12-28T16:30:42Z,1,"Can’t rate quality but poor customer service. Since I haven’t received it, after ordering it a month ago, nor did I receive the mock up email.I was looking forward to seeing my daughter’s surprise seeing her doggie on her college blanket. I’m wondering if it arrive in time for her departure back to school🤔."
PupSocks,2020-12-28T16:30:26Z,3,"Although the images were crisp and clear, I was disappointed in the material used to make the socks. It was some kind of synthetic not cotton and don’t seem practical or comfortable for actual wear."
PupSocks,2020-12-28T16:30:19Z,1,"12/3/20 I ordered a custom pair of socks, blue with my dogs face on them. 12/21/20 I received PINK socks with multiple cat faces on them.12/3/20 Email received after purchase: ""Hold tight while we get your order ready! You can expect to receive your order in 8 - 10 business days.""12/11/20 Email received: ""Great news! Your order is on its way. Order #2477848"" Complete with a picture of my pups face and invoice/order details.12/21/20: Package delivered to my mail box via USPS. Upon opening package I did not receive what I purchased, per confirmation and contract, but rather a pink pair of men's socks, with multiple cat faces on them. Definitely NOT blue and definitely NOT my dog. I have reached out several different ways to the company; Facebook, online/website chat, & email, but have YET to get a response. It's now been 6 days and your company does not seem to care about my concerns. Poor communication and customer service."
PupSocks,2020-12-28T16:29:47Z,1,"I received the wrong order from this company (wrong color socks AND completely wrong animal, not even my animal)I understand it's crazy holiday time but I have tried reaching out for the past two weeks, just simply asking for a refund! There wasn't even any return item directions in my package! At this point, I'm starting to think this company is a scam. They can send me NUMEROUS promo emails but can't respond ONCE to my wrong order email! At this point I won't advise anyone to shop here."
PupSocks,2020-12-28T16:29:05Z,1,Aweful. Ordered Black Friday sale and still havnt received them. There goes that Xmas present. I want a refund
PupSocks,2020-12-28T16:29:04Z,5,"Quality, fun socks! Excellent gift to give!"
PupSocks,2020-12-28T16:28:44Z,2,"I am so sorry to have to write a negative review-- The socks are very cute and good for novelty, but the fabric is unwearable, it is a synthetic nylon and just very uncomfortable."
PupSocks,2020-12-28T16:27:05Z,2,The picture I sent in of my dog was cropped so much that it didn’t look like him.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T16:26:36Z,1,These socks have a weird shape to them and can’t even be worn.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T16:25:13Z,5,"My son LOVED his socks!! Not only that, when there was a possibility that they might not arrive for Christmas (they arrived Christmas Eve!) the company actually sent a gift card via email with a photo of the socks that I could print off for Christmas Day - that's customer service above and beyond!!"
PupSocks,2020-12-28T16:22:25Z,5,Exactly what I ordered! My brother loved them!
PupSocks,2020-12-28T16:21:07Z,2,"Ok at best Took 5 weeks to receive the socks. Socks are ok quality but every time I reached out to customer service, it took 3 - 4 days to get a reply."
PupSocks,2020-12-28T16:19:19Z,5,"Socks were sooooo cute!!  Grandson loved them,    Thanks for the good job,"
PupSocks,2020-12-28T16:17:40Z,1,Ordered a blanket in November as a Christmas gift. Received USPS info that a label had created Dec 12. USPS has no record that package was actually given to them and Pupsocks is not answering any emails.  I had to open a Paypal case against them (of course they're till not responding). SHOP ELSEWHERE. PUPSOCKS ARE SCAMMERS!!!!!
PupSocks,2020-12-28T16:14:48Z,5,Really cute. Look just like the picture I sent in.And they got here earlier than expected. In time for Christmas.Everyone loved them.Thank you.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T16:14:28Z,5,"The blanket I ordered for my daughter for Christmas was her favorite gift this year!  The blanket was very soft and the quality was good.  I did have a problem with my original order (completely my fault...I ordered a Pup Blanket instead of the Cat Blanket).  I worked with Tyler in Customer Service, who was extremely helpful and nice.  He was able to get my order corrected and I received it in time for Christmas.  Will definitely order again!"
PupSocks,2020-12-28T16:10:49Z,2,I loved the idea of these sox for a gift but the quality isn't very good on the actual product and the image is very fuzzy even though I used a high res photo.  They also took about 3 weeks to arrive.  The only reason for two stars is that they give some of the proceeds to animal welfare charity.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T16:09:35Z,5,The ordering process was straightforward. I received all the items and they looked great. I would order again.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T16:08:37Z,1,Ordered socks on Nov 30. Shipping label was made Dec 7th and waiting to go to USPS. No update since then.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T16:08:12Z,1,It's been over 4 weeks and I have not received my order. My inquiries remain unanswered. Birthday and Christmas gifts missed. Very disappointed customer!
PupSocks,2020-12-28T16:05:54Z,5,These socks were a great gift! They feel like good material and the wife loved them. Thank you for a great gift!
PupSocks,2020-12-28T16:04:05Z,5,the whole family loved them!
PupSocks,2020-12-28T15:58:07Z,5,Love them! Comfortable and cute
PupSocks,2020-12-28T15:52:12Z,5,We love them! They are so cute!
PupSocks,2020-12-28T15:40:45Z,1,No order received Disappointed 😞 my friend ordered around the same time as I and she received her order
PupSocks,2020-12-28T15:38:44Z,1,I received the wrong package and reached out to customer service I presume and never heard back. I attempted many times and also contacted via Facebook and never received any explanation. My order arrived after Christmas nearly a month after I placed my order. Very disappointing.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T15:34:47Z,5,The joy on my girlfriend's face when she realized that these socks weren't just cats but *her* cats was completely worth it. These socks won Christmas. Will be ordering again.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T15:34:44Z,5,GREAT PRODUCT!
PupSocks,2020-12-28T15:34:25Z,5,Ordered a blanket and a pair of socks for wife for Christmas. Received order in timely fashion and wife LOVED them!  Nice good quality also.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T15:32:02Z,1,The Product hasn't arrived and is over 3 weeks late
PupSocks,2020-12-28T15:28:45Z,1,"Ordered 4 pairs.  The designer notes were completely ignored. The socks fit very small, so you should order a size larger than normal. They're also very uncomfortable, so only order for the novelty if you're dumb enough to order these at all."
PupSocks,2020-12-28T15:27:41Z,1,"Great idea for dog or cat lover, but these ‘socks’ are unwearable. I purchased a pair for my wife ( she loved our dog...true be told, so do I) for Christmas and while she thought they were cute, she could not wear them. They basically print the image on material, sew them together in a one end closed sleeve, and sell them as socks. My wife apologized to me, but threw them away since you can’t really wear them. Socks are pretty basic, amazing they can’t get that part right. I do not recommend anyone waste their money on these."
PupSocks,2020-12-28T15:26:54Z,4,Pull on sock already when received and fabric was tougher than I anticipated.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T15:24:26Z,5,"Love, love, love!!"
PupSocks,2020-12-28T15:24:17Z,3,"I love the idea and it super easy to order. However, the photos of the cats were cropped so close that the owner didn’t recognize them, and the quality of the socks were pretty bad."
PupSocks,2020-12-28T15:10:40Z,5,Look to be very strong durable socks. Have washed them once and they seem to be able to keep colors and pictures in good shape.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T15:07:55Z,1,My order did not arrive before Christmas.  Was placed in November.  Disappointed...
PupSocks,2020-12-28T15:01:12Z,5,Exactly what I ordered! Quick delivery!
PupSocks,2020-12-28T14:59:31Z,3,When the product arrived it looked great. The color and image was perfect. The issue is that the socks cannot be worn as the socks are not structured properly. Cannot get over the heel and the toe area is gigantic. Not sure what foot type they used as a template for the socks. They are the correct size.  Would not order again. Pricey too.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T14:54:57Z,5,Great quality and strong customer service.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T14:49:07Z,5,"Just have some patience with the shipping, but you will love the end product!  Excellent job transposing the picture onto the socks - Highly recommend - plus help the animals!"
PupSocks,2020-12-28T14:44:13Z,1,I never received my order. There's no number to call for customer service. I have tried to email twice to no avail.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T14:43:29Z,5,These socks were a huge hit. I think it's my 19 year old son's most coveted Christmas gift. He's leaving home in March and is so sad to leave his sweet dog. These make that sting a little less.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T14:32:57Z,4,"The socks aren't the greatest quality, but you knew that already. They are a bit on the thin side, and I guess because of how the printing is done, the socks have a heavy crease where they are folded in half. I bought these as a gift, so I'm not sure about the fit. They seem okay.The pets faces are amazing. I was a bit nervous since they don't send a proof or anything, but I had 4 pet faces done, and three of them are of dark-furred animals which don't always show up well. But the faces are great, well organized, well cropped, and very recognizable!"
PupSocks,2020-12-28T14:30:28Z,1,Terrible company. I asked for a modification of my order well in advance before the socks were made. They finally acknowledged after several emails that they got my request and would make it happen. Then the order arrived incorrectly still and several emails later still no remedy for me. I would highly advise you avoid doing business with them.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T14:26:30Z,1,I haven’t received my order until now.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T14:22:38Z,5,I ordered these socks as a Christmas gift for my friend.  It was perfect and she got the package right on time.  It's the perfect gift for someone who is hard to buy for.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T14:21:19Z,3,The photo came out great however I don't like the material of the socks. I wish they were cotton. They don't stay up. But the picture is cute.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T14:14:09Z,5,"Awesome socks!!!  Picture was clear & adorable!!  My daughter put them on immediately and they fit perfectly, she wears a size 10 shoe!  Material was nice thicker than expected. I definitely recommend!"
PupSocks,2020-12-28T14:03:10Z,4,"I placed my order on November 30, 2020 for Christmas presents. I STILL have not received my items (it’s now December 28, 2020) and was scrambling last minute to replace those Christmas presents. EDIT: I changed my review from one (1) star to four (4) stars because I did eventually receive my masks and they were adorable. Also, the company reached out and offered me a discount on my next order. I appreciate the follow up and will order from them again. Thank  you."
PupSocks,2020-12-28T13:55:39Z,1,Placed an order Nov 30. Got a notice of shipping on Dec 7. Socks have still not actually shipped. Reached out to the company twice and have had zero response back.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T13:50:09Z,5,Socks were exactly as expected and my daughter LOVED them!
PupSocks,2020-12-28T13:37:28Z,2,Picture looks great but the socks are terrible. They have no shape to them just a straight tube. Really dissapointed.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T13:30:26Z,3,"I can update when the order is received, but I haven't gotten it yet.Order placed 11/25 -shipped 12/19"
PupSocks,2020-12-28T13:05:16Z,1,"I ordered socks for my children for Christmas in November... in what should have been well enough time to process and arrive by 12/24. I’ve not seen the socks as of today 12/28, and getting my money back is not an option. The novelty has worn off at this point. I feel scammed."
PupSocks,2020-12-28T13:03:16Z,1,Ordered weeks ago for Christmas presents.  Still not received - got an email with a picture of them to send as presents.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T13:03:00Z,2,I wouldn’t buy these again for $42. For a pair of socks. Nothing special about the socks either.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T12:57:32Z,4,Fun socks.  Sizing is on the large side.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T12:54:47Z,5,these were at hit on Christmas morning!. great quality. the pup's pics turned out perfect.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T12:15:12Z,1,"I would really like to give this review a 4 or 5 star.  I ordered the socks, submitted my photo.  The socks came and our dog who is completely white came back with a tan forehead.  Also the material of the socks was really weird.  Not sock material.  I email my issue regarding the photo more than the material of the socks, just wanting a redo, not my money back.  I have not heard back.  I guess the only thing I can say positive about this product is that it arrived very quickly. Quick production, bad product and customer service.  By the way I did not give the socks as a Xmas gift."
PupSocks,2020-12-28T12:07:22Z,5,Love the PupSocks!  Gave as a gift and they were a big hit!  They did a great job cropping out our pups head and even kept in her favorite toy she was snuggling.  The whole process was very easy too.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T10:59:26Z,1,Ordered 3 custom pupsocks blankets with my rescue cats face on them for Christmas gifts. I had a understanding it was a company based in the southern US but they also advertised Canadian shipping. Very unhappy ordered Nov 25 2020 they are still sitting in Georgia. What really upset me was seeing the ads for pupsocks right up to Christmas thinking where is my product I paid American currency for.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T09:17:53Z,1,"ordered on the 20th of November, now it’s the 28th of December and I still haven’t received my order..."
PupSocks,2020-12-28T09:16:16Z,1,"Order placed on December 1st. December 28th, nothing received. The only customer service response is an auto-reply email. Check out the comments on their Facebook page before you order."
PupSocks,2020-12-28T08:57:59Z,1,"I'm asking to review an order that I placed on Nov 29th for 1 pr of socks that I still HAVE NOT received and today is Dec 28th.  When I ordered the site said all items would ship in 5-8 days........ maybe they meant months!  I have sent 3 separate emails requesting a ship date for this XMas gift and have only received a ""mass"" reply that my order was in production and I would be notified once it shipped. Businesses that operate like this do need to be in business. This was my 2nd order and had a similar experience on my first order by wanted to give Pupsocks another chance......My mistake, definately won't be a 3rd chance.  Buy something from somewhere else or order 3 months early. Hate to give 1 star as it's too much."
PupSocks,2020-12-28T08:32:16Z,5,"The blanket I ordered arrived a little late, but the communication with customer service was so helpful, and shipping during the holidays this year was certainly tough. The quality of the blanket is wonderful and I can't wait to give it to the recipient."
PupSocks,2020-12-28T07:44:36Z,5,I ordered the socks as Christmas gifts for my children. They loved them.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T07:42:11Z,1,Missing delivere and no reply. I ordered socks early in december as a Christmas present. Still not received any - I have sent an email about a week before Christmas - got an autoreply - telling they will need 72 hours to reply - still not got any socks or reply.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T07:36:37Z,1,I ordered my socks on the 24th November 2020 and as at 28 December 2020 they are yet to arrive. Any feedback on this item would be welcome.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T06:44:58Z,5,Loved the ducks
PupSocks,2020-12-28T06:39:15Z,1,Horrible. Zero customer service. My package was empty- no socks. No one to call. Sent emails. No contact. Waste of $$ and loss of gift.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T06:37:25Z,5,got these as a gift for my boyfriend and they came out absolutely perfect
PupSocks,2020-12-28T05:58:53Z,4,The socks were great but very expensive.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T05:57:15Z,1,Ordered on Black Friday. Never received my order and was not able to give the gifts I purchased for Christmas presents.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T05:47:26Z,1,My order has not been delivered
PupSocks,2020-12-28T05:46:51Z,2,Neat idea with a variety of products but it is taking forever to ship and unfortunately the expected delivery before Christmas has passed and the tracking provided shows nothing.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T05:24:13Z,1,Ordered item over a month ago. Have yet to receive it. Receiving this survey before I receive what I ordered isn’t helping your company or your survey scores.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T05:22:25Z,2,"We were expecting a nicer sock for the price...it felt like a compression sock material only not so nice...we got it for a gift, but they are not really wearable. If you are looking for something to hang on the wall....this is it."
PupSocks,2020-12-28T05:18:24Z,1,"The product that arrived was NOT my dog!!!  No response from customer service after almost 2 weeks of trying.  No phone number, only automated email responses with irrelevant info.  A total waste of money!"
PupSocks,2020-12-28T04:35:49Z,5,"The image was perfect, true to the photo! And the Sox are good quality! And the blanket is beautiful! I highly recommend these products if you want your pets on your Sox!"
PupSocks,2020-12-28T04:24:45Z,5,Turned out fantastic!
PupSocks,2020-12-28T04:15:42Z,4,"The picture of my dog came out great.  The sock fabric is a bit strange - not like real fabric but rather a slick, plastic-y substance.  But other than that, it's fine."
PupSocks,2020-12-28T04:14:03Z,1,"Ordered November 19 for Christmas, max shipping stated 18 working days. Product didn't ship until a couple of days before Christmas, and is still in transit so I couldn't give these gifts at Christmas time. If delays are occurring, shipping time should have been stated honestly and transparently. I emailed PupSocks on the day I was advised shipping was to occur to ask if they could send them in an expedited manner (I was prepared to pay extra for this) and I still have not had the courtesy of a response."
PupSocks,2020-12-28T03:59:42Z,5,"Perfect gift, the photo was clear and resized perfectly. They shipped on time even with the holiday rush!"
PupSocks,2020-12-28T03:58:06Z,1,Never received order
PupSocks,2020-12-28T03:55:31Z,5,I have given the blankets as gifts twice and both times the recipients were thrilled. They came out so nice and the quality was great.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T03:53:29Z,1,"Never received our socks. Just an empty sealed bag. Nor have I received a reply to any email, phone call or social media attempt to contact. It’s a scam!!!!!!!"
PupSocks,2020-12-28T03:44:42Z,5,Thank you so much! We love our Pupsocks. Great holiday gift. The picture came out good. The white pair look the best!
PupSocks,2020-12-28T03:35:05Z,1,It has been a month since they were shipped and no tentative date for delivery. Very disappointed.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T03:30:16Z,1,I ordered the socks on Nov 29 and still have not received them on 12/27.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T03:17:44Z,3,The look of the socks is cute- the quality of the socks is awful. There is no shape to the sock just a big long rectangle with a hole at the top.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T03:00:33Z,5,I gave purple socks featuring our adored Corgi’s face to the members of my family for Christmas.  Everyone LOVED them.  They were absolutely the BEST gifts for everyone.  Thank you PupSocks!!
PupSocks,2020-12-28T02:52:28Z,5,Quality far exceeded my expectations!
PupSocks,2020-12-28T02:50:09Z,5,"Pleased with everything..ease of ordering, quick turnaround during the height of the holiday season, quality snd the smile it out in the recipient’a face. They are an adorable gift."
PupSocks,2020-12-28T02:34:41Z,5,Perfect! Great present.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T02:30:03Z,1,"If I could give a rating less than 1, I would.  My package supposedly shipped on 12/10.  Other than a shipping label getting printed, there is ZERO shipping/tracking information.  I have contacted PupSocks three times now about my missing order (they already took my money), and NO response other than the same automated response all 3 times blaming USPS.  However, I have order things from other companies after I placed this order that were shipped USPS, and made it before Christmas.  NO tracking information, NO response, NO product.  I will tell everyone I know NOT to order from this company."
PupSocks,2020-12-28T02:25:25Z,5,"Website is easy to operate, quality socks!"
PupSocks,2020-12-28T02:21:08Z,3,The person I bought these for loved them. But I was a bit disappointed with the quality of the picture of the dog on the socks. It looks nothing like what is advertised on the website
PupSocks,2020-12-28T02:12:50Z,2,"The pictures of the dog came out perfect however the socks are not a comfortable material. Just expected them to be more comfortable. It’s good for a gag gift, I just expected a little better"
PupSocks,2020-12-28T01:53:11Z,5,"The socks are adorable- I bought them for my two teenagers- 17 and 19- our dog is aging, what a wonderful tribute they are to our precious family pet.  Thank you very  much"
PupSocks,2020-12-28T01:45:42Z,1,"I placed my order the Saturday after Thanksgiving. I received confirmation on my order. Two days later I received an email that my pictures were too dark. Fair enough, I sent them new pictures the same day. Followed up with 4 emails to which I have never received a response. It is now over a month, after Christmas and I still don’t have an answer on the status of my order or the socks. I’d think twice about ordering anything. Their follow up is horrible."
PupSocks,2020-12-28T01:39:34Z,1,I ordered my order a month ago to come in time for Christmas. On 12/9 I got a notification that a note had been added with a tracking number and since then it hasn’t changed from “pre-shipment” I feel I left adequate time to fulfill this order and was extremely disappointed I could not give my gift on Christmas.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T01:29:31Z,1,"I have not received my order, which was placed almost a month ago and was supposed to be a Christmas gift. The website at the time said it usually ships in around 8 days.I have also not received any updates. Completely dissatisfied."
PupSocks,2020-12-28T01:23:43Z,5,Received in time for xmas and everyone got a kick our of them. The photo looked great. Very happy with the purchase.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T01:23:38Z,1,Order was received after Christmas and was the wrong blanket! Very disappointed!
PupSocks,2020-12-28T01:18:20Z,1,I ordered 2 items at the end of November for Christmas and I still don’t have them. Not cool. Don’t recommend if you are in Canada
PupSocks,2020-12-28T01:15:48Z,4,"Delightful and clever idea. I got the socks for my wife as a present. Per her: Material is a little uncomfortable and fits a bit weird, but the design is great and it’s nice for my wife to have socks with our cats on them."
PupSocks,2020-12-28T01:10:39Z,1,"I ordered 2 blankets on 11/26/20, it is now 12/27/20 and I still have not received my order."
PupSocks,2020-12-28T01:09:42Z,1,"I ordered in November, and by December 22, the order was still “in production”. So 0% chance of Christmas delivery, which is something Pupsocks advertised on Black Friday. I messaged them 3 times across 3 different platforms throughout December -  no reply. After cancelling the order, they stole $9 USD from me. Facebook comments are littered with this same story. Never again. Absolute scammers."
PupSocks,2020-12-28T01:06:55Z,5,I ordered blankets with my kid’s dogs on them. They came a little delayed but still in time for Christmas. They were amazing!! They are so soft and the pics were perfect. I highly recommend Pupsocks and will definitely order from them again!!
PupSocks,2020-12-28T01:02:35Z,1,"I've purchased from competing brands before, but I decided to try PupSocks this year for a Christmas gift. I placed my first order in November, but noticed that the shipping address was missing a number around the time it was shipped (admittedly my mistake). I immediately contacted the post office who told me the package was returned to sender. I tried to contact PupSocks to try to find my order and to try to re-order the same gift without having to go through the design process again. Their site doesn't have a phone number, only a messaging service with a 24-hour turnaround time. I only heard back from PupSocks a full seven days after my original message, when I just decided to order another pair of socks and sent a second message to request my original order be refunded. When customer service did get back to me, their response was ""here's your USPS tracking number, it looks like it's being held at your post office"" when the link clearly stated the package was returned to sender. With the second order, I paid more for 2-day delivery and guaranteed receipt before Christmas and left a note of my prior order to the designer in an attempt to speed along the process. I got an email stating that my order shipped on December 21 but according to the FedEx tracking, although the label was created on the 21st, the item has still not been received by FedEx on December 27th. The only notice I got from PupSocks was an email on the 24th with no accountability at all and certainly no mention of a refund for the ""Christmas guarantee""- just an ""understanding that current circumstances with Covid-related delays can be disappointing"" and a picture of my order. So now I'm out the price of 2 pairs of custom socks, 1 rush delivery, and had no gift to give my brother. Save the hassle and find another service."
PupSocks,2020-12-28T01:00:48Z,1,I still haven’t received my order from over a month ago!!!! Keeping getting shipping notices that say my package had been everywhere except delivered.  I would like to actually get my order. Very diassapointed!
PupSocks,2020-12-28T00:58:15Z,1,Ordered the socks over a month ago and haven’t received them yet.  Very disappointed that I didn’t get For my daughter for Xmas.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T00:48:57Z,5,Love the pup socks
PupSocks,2020-12-28T00:37:43Z,2,"Hi, I ordered a pair of PupSocks as a holiday gift for my partner - we love our pups and the thought of seeing their faces on a pair of socks is truly a fantastic gift!  While the design and concept is very nice, the fit is below par, which was disappointing.  I followed the sizing chart on the website but it did not matter; the socks are an extremely odd shape and do not fit.  Very big bummer, especially at the price. TR"
PupSocks,2020-12-28T00:36:46Z,4,"Socks were given as a gift and were a big hit. They seem like good quality. The only consideration is that they took a while to get to me after I ordered them, so they couldn't be a last minute gift."
PupSocks,2020-12-28T00:30:38Z,1,I still have not received my order placed on 11/29. I want a refund.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T00:25:41Z,1,Where is my order???
PupSocks,2020-12-28T00:22:06Z,1,"Who knows how the merchandise is because I’ve yet to receive it. Placed my order 11.28.20, today is 12.27.20. No response via email, Instagram or DM.  On 12.20.20 via Instagram, the CEO begged for patience and blamed the post office on the shipment delays.  But that never stopped PUPSOCKS from sending me marketing emails - DAILY - until 12.2330 offering discounts on new orders AND GUARANTEED 2-DAY DELIVERY OR A REFUND. What????   I placed a $100 order in good faith, in November, and still haven’t received it. But if I give you more money and place a new order - I’ll get it?  Disgusting, greedy business practices. I want a refund!"
PupSocks,2020-12-28T00:20:48Z,5,I got both my sister’s dogs’ heads on a large blanket for Christmas. It could not have turned out better and I highly recommend this company.
PupSocks,2020-12-28T00:17:35Z,1,"I still haven't received my blanket, I ordered it back on November 11th."
PupSocks,2020-12-28T00:09:59Z,5,The socks came out perfectly. I was impressed that PupSocks was able to expertly crop the photo I sent such that it includes only my dog's head. Nice job!!
PupSocks,2020-12-28T00:02:38Z,1,Ordered in November .... haven't arrived yet. I sent a message and got a crappy response. Sad :(
PupSocks,2020-12-28T00:02:33Z,5,Amazing quality! Ordered a blanket and socks and they're exactly as I hoped they'd be. Arrived just in time for Christmas! I'm sure I'll order again. Thanks!
PupSocks,2020-12-28T00:02:18Z,2,"Delay in order shipment caused this to not be delivered in time for Christmas.  Tracking said the label was created on 12/15, but it didn't get received at the post office until a week later on 12/22.    Gave 2 stars instead of 1 because they did do apparent quality work and at the last minute sent a consolation e-mail to print to give as a gift instead of the actual product."
PupSocks,2020-12-27T23:48:28Z,5,Wonderful quality! Lots of tears remembering my friend’s BFF ( best fur friend) and his beautiful memory! Thank you!
PupSocks,2020-12-27T23:42:06Z,1,"Still haven't received my order I placed in November for Christmas.  They keep creating a ""shipping label"" that never leaves their ""warehouse""."
PupSocks,2020-12-27T23:34:08Z,5,The socks were perfect and so cute.  Love how soft the material is also! Highly recommend~~
PupSocks,2020-12-27T23:25:02Z,5,"I suppose I am a little puppy-crazy, but it was great fun to give pup socks to my dog's best people friends. The resolution was pretty good in the images, even though my originals were not extremely high quality, and the colors are bright and cheerful. My 4 recipients say the socks are comfortable. I liked that you build each pair of socks separately, and individualize each one!"
PupSocks,2020-12-27T23:18:26Z,1,"The socks I ordered were damaged when delivered. I was disappointed with the quality and requested a refund. Without a conversation, or my approval, the pupsocks sent another shipment of the same order. I do not want more of the poor quality product, I just want my money back. I still have not heard back from customer service."
PupSocks,2020-12-27T23:11:23Z,4,"I really liked how the socks looked like, the colors were bright and clear, and our cat's picture was nicely done. But the fit of the sock is not great, the material is not flexible enough to comfortably fit."
PupSocks,2020-12-27T23:03:05Z,1,Order placed Nov 29 for a 10 year old for Xmas.  Nothing from Pup Socks for over 3 weeks when I finally reached out to find out order status. I never actually got a reply from Pup Socks as I kept getting delivery delays to their TEAM email but I got a shipping notification but as of Dec 28th NOTHING.  Ruined my sons Xmas.  In process of PayPal resolution as I want a refund for an order that was placed in plenty of time for Xmas but the ineptitude of Pup Socks messed it up.
PupSocks,2020-12-27T22:57:18Z,1,Material was awful feeling. No form to the sock. The cost was way over priced. Would not order again.
PupSocks,2020-12-27T22:57:11Z,2,"Have yet to receive my order so no idea how well you did but my order was Nov 29th, supposedly shipped on December 18th.  Have yet to receive anything. Still sitting in the Atlanta USPS facility. Pony Express would have been quicker."
PupSocks,2020-12-27T22:54:40Z,1,This is the second time that I have been asked to review the product that I order on 11/29/20and have yet to receive.  I did send an email inquiry and received an acknowledgment of the email and that someone would respond but have not heard anything back yet.
PupSocks,2020-12-27T22:48:14Z,1,"Ordered on 11/26. Promised no later than 12/11. On 12/11 my order was still in production. I politely reached out, and got a form email back on 12/18 still promising my order by 12/25. On 12/22 I received an email stating my order shipped. Today, 12/27 there is still no progress in said order. No response from the company.  Horrible customer service. Just want a refund. I went to the BBB website and they have a horrible reputation, but clearly do nothing to improve it. Don’t order from this company. Many other sites better than this."
PupSocks,2020-12-27T22:44:52Z,1,I’d love to review this product except I NEVER RECEIVED IT!!! No one ever responds to your emails asking for an update on the status of your product. It’s been an entire month since I ordered. There’s even a Facebook group of hundreds of people who have also been scammed and never gotten their items. The. Worst. Company. Ever.
PupSocks,2020-12-27T22:38:20Z,1,"I ordered 3 pairs of socks as Christmas gifts, Nov 29, I have yet to see any of these socks which should have arrived weeks ago. Very unsatisfied."
PupSocks,2020-12-27T22:33:48Z,2,Delivery has so far taken 5 weeks and still waiting. They did send a Christmas card though!
PupSocks,2020-12-27T22:32:45Z,1,I still don't have the order and it was made on December 9th. I was sent a postcard as consolation... not good.
PupSocks,2020-12-27T22:32:16Z,1,"I have been waiting for the package for a month now and for the last two weeks no new update on the package.  Also, I haven't received any response from the company yet."
PupSocks,2020-12-27T22:27:25Z,2,I still have not received my socks yet! May I suggest rather than  sending out reviews please process people’s orders!
PupSocks,2020-12-27T22:23:22Z,3,Arrived after Christmas so like a month after I ordered. Also the sock quality is not that nice. Nylon and look big. The quality of the images is good tho. Wouldn’t bother ordering from them again and wouldn’t recommend.
PupSocks,2020-12-27T22:16:12Z,3,The picture was great but the sock material was quite poor.
PupSocks,2020-12-27T22:14:06Z,2,"Well, we didn’t get our order yet.  Missed Xmas.  So that’s not good. On the plus side , I did appreciate getting an email mockup so I could show my daughter and wife what their present will look like"
PupSocks,2020-12-27T22:10:36Z,1,Photo looks great but socks are of a weird nylon that does have enough elastic.  They are uncomfortable and do not stay up.  One pair ordered was defective - no elastic at all in half the sock and customer service has not responded.  Web site says only return within 7 days even though these were a Christmas gift.
PupSocks,2020-12-27T22:09:53Z,5,My husband was so excited when he opened his pair of socks with our cat's face all over it. He kept posing for pictures next to the cat because he was in disbelief of how lifelike the images were. Thanks for a gift he will always love.
PupSocks,2020-12-27T22:02:09Z,5,"These are incredible! They took the perfect cutout of my pups’ faces for the socks, and my husband loved his gift! They were so awesome looking, my sister-in-law also had to order a couple pair for her husband."
PupSocks,2020-12-27T21:59:54Z,5,So fun! Great for a gift!
PupSocks,2020-12-27T21:58:13Z,4,"The socks are cute and fit pretty well, but the quality is a little poor. They’re not very soft and the image stretches out a fair bit when you put them on. All in all I like them but they’re more of a novelty than anything else."
PupSocks,2020-12-27T21:53:51Z,1,quality was very poor socks ripped not good at all
PupSocks,2020-12-27T21:36:24Z,5,I ordered the blanket and socks with my daughter's cat's face as a Christmas present. She LOVED them and they were the perfect gift. Nice quality materials and excellent delivery service. Thanks for a great gift!
PupSocks,2020-12-27T21:33:34Z,1,I do not have my product yet ????? Why ????
PupSocks,2020-12-27T21:28:47Z,1,"No idea about quality etc, but it has been over a month and I still have not received my order."
PupSocks,2020-12-27T21:23:54Z,1,"Ordered in November with promises that my order would be done way before Christmas. My order sat in Atlanta with a label created (not even given to USPS). I tried to contact the company and got no response until Christmas Eve. The company said my order had been lost and blamed the post office. My order never even went anywhere. I would not trust this company. I was out 4 Christmas gifts this year. To top that off, this company was still advertising that they could get people items if they ordered by Dec 11.  That was the date that I was told my order had shipped.  Many people did not get their orders in time this year and it was not because of the post office.Finally received our order after the new year. It was missing items took another couple of weeks to try to fix that. My daughters finally got their Christmas gifts today. Keep in mind, I ordered these in November. Not acceptable"
PupSocks,2020-12-27T21:23:38Z,5,Still have not received my order today. These were Christmas presents for family members and had to go out at the last minute to get replacement gifts.  Disappointed that they have been stuck in the mail system for over 2 weeks and have no idea when they will be received.
PupSocks,2020-12-27T21:23:30Z,5,"Great socks...fast design, delibery and the image was clear. Lots of design options and sizes to choose from. The colours vibrant. A all round fun experience."
PupSocks,2020-12-27T21:12:08Z,5,Adorable!  Even made it in time for Christmas!
PupSocks,2020-12-27T21:12:04Z,1,"Not worth the trouble. Placed two orders. One arrived on timely manner. The other was nothing but trouble, I contacted the company many times, no response. Nothing updated on tracking, was told they’d replace. Finally received email saying they’d replace and new tracking number would be coming in 5-7 days. Never received the email. Would not recommend."
PupSocks,2020-12-27T21:10:56Z,5,I bought 4 pairs for gifts and was very pleased as were the recipients. Great quality and the pet faces were excellent.
PupSocks,2020-12-27T21:08:24Z,4,"The idea of having the luxury to put your pet/s face on socks and other things is pretty cool, but does it really take (almost) a month to create 2 pairs of socks & send them out? I originally put my order in on the 25th of November and received it the week of Christmas, cutting it REAL close as these socks were an X-mas gift. I'm hoping this big delay is just a one time thing and has to do with the whole virus thing because it almost makes me think twice about putting another order in if it normally takes this long to create and ship out.Aside from this complaint, the socks came out nicely, but on one of them the cat's face was smaller compared to the other pair of socks which also had a cat's face. The socks with the smaller face seemed to make up for it by putting more amounts of the feline's face though... perhaps for an upcoming order I should mention something about the sizing of what's going on the socks?"
PupSocks,2020-12-27T21:07:30Z,1,"I’d prefer to give 0 stars. I ordered my item Nov 29. At the time the site said I would receive my item in 8-10 days. It is now Dec 27 and I still don’t have my product. I was assured on Dec 10th that I would have it before Christmas. I’ve tried to cancel numerous times. Dec 18 I received an email that it shipped but still don’t have my product. Terrible customer service, I’ve sent numerous emails and they don’t answer your questions they just avoid the topic."
PupSocks,2020-12-27T20:59:45Z,1,"Ordered November 30th.  It's now December 27th and there is no sign of the socks or a response from customer service.  Unless you can wait 2 months for an order, i would suggest not purchasing socks from them."
PupSocks,2020-12-27T20:58:19Z,1,I ordered for Christmas on dec 8 because website said 8 to 10 day for delivery. My order didnt even ship till dec 19 at 6 pm. So ita now the 27 and i still havent recieved my order. Got 2 automat3d replies from my inquiries into what was going on. I spent 120 on blanket and socks for a present for my wife. So i had to scramble to find aomething else at the last minute with money i didnt have to spend and for my troubles i got a 20 percent off on my next order instead of a real apology or partial refund. Very dissappointed in the customer service. Will not recommend or purchase again.
PupSocks,2020-12-27T20:57:47Z,1,I would give zero stars if I could!! I ordered these socks November 27th and still haven’t received them! They were supposed to be Christmas presents for my kids. Hopefully I’ll get them by their birthday in February.
PupSocks,2020-12-27T20:56:11Z,3,I placed an order on Nov 30.   Had NO communication with pupsocks until I requested a refund because I had never received my order.  I then received my order.  The socks were hideous but the blanket seemed ok.  Very dissatisfied with their customer service
PupSocks,2020-12-27T20:45:51Z,5,Awesome purchase! I sent in a picture with a cat and a human and asked for just the cat - totally captured him perfectly. Greatest Christmas present to date!
PupSocks,2020-12-27T20:33:57Z,4,"My college aged kids got a kick out of seeing their favorite pets on socks. However, the socks are not comfortable to wear. The fabric is strange."
PupSocks,2020-12-27T20:31:53Z,2,Could not contact customer service.  Place my order Nov 30 received my item after Christmas. My item was ordered for a cat and it came with dog bones on it.  Will go elsewhere next time.
PupSocks,2020-12-27T20:29:02Z,5,The image on the socks is clear and looks just like our pet!
PupSocks,2020-12-27T20:26:21Z,1,"This is my second experience purchasing from PupSocks and both times now the items I've ordered have been ridiculously late—including the order I placed a month ago that has still not arrived. I placed a basic order of 1 mask with 1 dog a month ago (in November), leaving more than enough time to arrive before Christmas considering the website advertises that orders are shipped out in 1-3 business days. The item I ordered did not ship until December 19th!! It is now December 27th and the item is still in Florida and hasn't moved (I live in Canada). Do yourself a favour and do not order these as presents unless you can give yourself several months leeway—I did not have the present to give my Mom for Christmas. The first time I ordered was a year & a half ago (in May) where the same thing happened and they used the same excuse of receiving an influx of orders; I figured in a year and a half they would have figured it out so I gave them another chance, yet alas, they have yet to learn how to appropriately plan & allocate resources. That said, they clearly have no problem still advertising misleading shipping & production times that they know they are not able to meet, which I find dishonest. If you know you're extremely behind and can't handle the volume of orders coming in, make sure that is clearly reflected on the website so people can make their own decision before placing an order. I absolutely love that they help animals in need, but these two experiences have been extremely disappointing and I can no longer deem PupSocks a trusted company to purchase gifts from."
PupSocks,2020-12-27T20:24:20Z,1,"Incredibly slow shipping. Even with COVID, the items I ordered in November have still not arrived and it is now December 27th. Very disappointed."
PupSocks,2020-12-27T20:22:34Z,3,Item arrived after Christmas despite being ordered in plenty of time.
PupSocks,2020-12-27T20:20:41Z,5,"It was so easy to order, and received my order promptly. They did a beautiful job cropping the pictures, and the socks came out great! Socks are high quality and they seem like they will wash well. Present was a real hit and I would highly recommend! A real nice touch they sent me a high quality digital card with a picture of the socks that I could give if the socks were delayed in the mail as so many packages have been this season. Luckily I had received my order but that was a thoughtful thing to do."
PupSocks,2020-12-27T20:19:15Z,2,"A little pricey but I accept that for the donation made to good cause. I entered special instructions for the cropping of the photo I uploaded that were not followed. Just a few hours after I placed my order, I remembered something I needed to add to it, so I went through the “contact us” link, I included my order number, added my question. I did not hear back for 4 days & was then told that it was too late to make any changes. I placed a second smaller order on 12/8 which I still have not received yet. I sent an inquiry about it on 12/17 and have not had any reply to that at all.I realize that close to Christmas, shipping is uncertain, but the lack of communication, the slow “production time” and ignoring special instructions that are asked for when an order is placed, are pretty unacceptable. Sorry, but I will not be ordering through pup socks in the future."
PupSocks,2020-12-27T20:17:18Z,5,"Easy to order, great reproduction of the photos.  Order arrived fast, very straightforward and communicative company.  Definitely 5 stars!"
PupSocks,2020-12-27T20:15:06Z,1,"I’ve ordered socks from them before with no issue, but after this last time, I never will again. I ordered a pair, then received an empty package in the mail. It had nothing in it, not even a packing slip. I’ve emailed the company twice (since the 18th, writing this on the 27th), and they have not responded. I’m going to have to dispute the charge with the bank at this point."
PupSocks,2020-12-27T20:04:21Z,2,The product turned out great but I ordered it on Nov 30 to have it as a Christmas gift and received it the day after Xmas. Even though I was receiving emails from them a week before Xmas claiming I could still place an order and get it in time for Xmas.
PupSocks,2020-12-27T20:03:00Z,5,My daughter LOVED her pupsocks! Perfect Christmas gift!
PupSocks,2020-12-27T19:57:29Z,1,"Order showed as delivered by USPS, but never arrived. I have tried to contact pupsocks twice to address problem, but no response."
PupSocks,2020-12-27T19:50:47Z,5,I think these socks turned out absolutely adorable!  They are soft and comfortable to wear and I strongly recommend these for a cute gift for family of friends!
PupSocks,2020-12-27T19:43:03Z,1,I had sent multiple emails inquiring about my order never heard back until I stated I was going to report the company due to the fact I was not getting answers concerning my order now I just received an email stating my order shipped after I stated a refund due to the fact that it took too long and I no longer need as it was a gift for an out-of-town traveler I still have not really heard from anyone regarding the last email nor have I received a credit I would not recommend this company I will never order again and I will continue until Until I receive a credit for the product
PupSocks,2020-12-27T19:15:52Z,5,I purchased a pair of the socks that look like Christmas wrapping paper for my friend and put all of his furkids on it. They arrived pretty quickly (to Canada during a pandemic) and he loved them!They looked great! Was a PAWESOME way to brighten his day!
PupSocks,2020-12-27T19:14:41Z,1,"Nope. Don’t do it. Cute idea, I completely agree. My nieces would have LOVED them. However, the company has TERRIBLE customer service! I ordered on 11/18. I asked to have my order canceled on 12/14. Received no response, then a shipment email on 12/16. They “shipped” my 4 pairs of socks, but I only had 1 pair in the package. And, the quality was terrible! I wish I could give them zero stars. They don’t even deserve 1."
PupSocks,2020-12-27T19:03:51Z,1,I placed my order over 4 weeks ago and still haven’t received my product.
PupSocks,2020-12-27T19:03:03Z,3,"The socks are okay; I personally would not buy them again. I bought one pair of Pupsocks and one pair of Horsesocks for my girlfriend for Christmas and they weren't the hit I had hoped they would be, especially considering how much I paid for them. The design itself is as I expected, but the sock material is very unusual and so is the stitching. The socks are flat on the vertical axis instead of horizontal, so they fit very oddly and the seams rub against your toes. The insides of the socks are white. I expect the white insides and the odd stitching is due to the printing process. We will wear the socks, but they aren't particularly comfortable and I'm not that impressed overall."
PupSocks,2020-12-27T19:02:36Z,1,"I ordered pupsocks on 11/21.  In spite of being told they shipped on 11/27, the carrier does not show they were received and there is no way to track them. I have sent two emails and had no response. I also called 3x - once I couldn’t get through at all, and 2x their own customer service folks apparently disconnected me when I said “no” to an additional purchase. I will have to dispute the charge with my credit card company. Very disappointing, not to mention a huge waste of my time."
PupSocks,2020-12-27T19:00:57Z,1,I ordered these in November for my daughter for Christmas. I’ve yet to receive them.
PupSocks,2020-12-27T19:00:38Z,1,"I received my order more than 2 weeks late.   Now I have to make arrangements to get these gifts to whom they were intended.  I am very disappointed. I did not get to see a preview,  they put cat faces on a dog blanket(it had dog paws and bones on it) they did not outline the dog pictures correctly either.  I would not order from here again."
PupSocks,2020-12-27T19:00:38Z,1,Still haven’t received my order. Can’t get in touch with customer service.
PupSocks,2020-12-27T19:00:25Z,5,Absolutely love these products! The quality can’t be beat!
PupSocks,2020-12-27T18:50:37Z,1,We were SO disappointed to get the socks.. horrible quality socks and once you put the on the graphics stretch so you don’t know what you’re looking at. I can’t justifying buying anything else from this company.
PupSocks,2020-12-27T18:42:42Z,3,"I was very happy with the look of the products. Unfortunately, the socks are not very comfortable, and the mask I ordered was extremely small. It looks like it should be a child's size, but there is no indication of this on the site. The mask doesn't fit the person I bought it for, so it will need another layer of fabric added under it to fully cover her face."
PupSocks,2020-12-27T18:41:38Z,5,"The socks captured perfectly the photo I had uploaded of our friend’s cat. He loved the socks! this is the 2nd time I have ordered from you, product quality & photo likeness is amazing! Thank you!"
PupSocks,2020-12-27T18:33:08Z,1,Took the longest time to receive my socks and then when they arrived they weren’t my dog. Some strange dog’s face.
PupSocks,2020-12-27T18:28:20Z,4,The image was perfectly transferred! The only issue I had was that I asked for the dark blue and I received the light blue.
PupSocks,2020-12-27T18:24:30Z,2,"These socks do not fit regular feet. I ordered the appropriate size for my husband, but the socks do not taper at the toe like normal socks. Instead they are just huge squares at the toe which make them way too large and awkward to wear. Really disappointed especially given the price for one pair."
PupSocks,2020-12-27T18:23:36Z,5,My daughter ordered a pair of PupSocks last year for a friend and I really like them. My daughter got adopted a puppy Our Grand this September so for Christmas I ordered her the socks and a mask. They were her only presents this year! Of course she is 26 so it wasn't like she was expecting a ton of gifts. Fortunately I ordered in time for both to arrive in time for Christmas .
PupSocks,2020-12-27T18:22:22Z,1,"The image of our cat is cute but I would like my money back. I ordered a 10-13 Men’s for my husband who wears size 10.5 and he couldn’t get the sock around his foot. I wear a Women’s size 8. I tried to put them on and they didn’t fit me either. The fabric does not stretch with your heal. They’re the worst fabric and design for a sock I’ve ever seen. I was really excited to give these to him. I’m embarrassed they don’t fit.    Not to mention the other pair I ordered for my stepdad. They never showed up. I ordered them three weeks before Xmas. Now that I know they won’t fit, I’d like my money back for them as well. Horrible product. Do not order these. Even if you have the skinniest foot in the world (my calves are like 3 inches in diameter at the base of my heal) they do not fit. It’s a wonderful idea! But the fact that they don’t show up and are unwearable makes them a complete waste of money. I literally have wasted $70 for 2 pairs plus the $40 more I had to spend on another present for my a stepdad because the socks didn’t arrive on time. -Extremely Perturbed Customer"
PupSocks,2020-12-27T18:17:16Z,5,These were my daughter's favorite Christmas present.  The pictures of our cat and dog were perfect.
PupSocks,2020-12-27T18:16:17Z,1,Took nearly a month to get
PupSocks,2020-12-27T18:16:15Z,1,Still haven’t recieved my 4 weeks ago ordered socks. Hope to get them some day :(
PupSocks,2020-12-27T18:14:51Z,5,The socks came out just right! They came out exactly how I wanted them to and the person who received them had lost the dog recently and said it was the perfect way to remember their dog!
PupSocks,2020-12-27T18:07:26Z,1,"I had a very bad experience with your company. I placed an order the last week of November, purchase of $203.00, I sent two emails on December asking the status of my order. I received a reply to the emails saying order was in process and later the order was in transit with a tracking number.When checked tracking number I kept getting the same message. ""A ticket was requested waiting for item"". After that I sent four more emails asking what was going on. No replies to those emails. I finally decided to dispute the charges with my bank on December 22nd. I also send an email to let you know that, and still no reply. Two days later I received the items I ordered. Bag had been sent on a two day delivery. One of the blankets was missing a picture of a pet. I won't even try to correct that. But, I will never order anything from your company. I will block all advertisements you send to me, and I already started to tell friends do not order anything from this place."
PupSocks,2020-12-27T18:05:46Z,1,Order was placed on Nov. 28.  Still have not received on Dec. 27.
PupSocks,2020-12-27T18:01:58Z,1,first order one pair was wrong...it had some cats on it but not ours and the size was wrong and there was a hole in them...I have reached out and they corrected it but this time used the cat from my second order...so still wrong...no one has reached out since...second order still have not received ordered Nov 29so not impressed...then they send me credits to buy more in their store...well my first 2 orders are not correct yet...why would i order more...very dissapointed
PupSocks,2020-12-27T18:01:36Z,4,"Great gift! Picture was spot on. However, the quality of the socks could have been better for the price. Socks are true to size. I sized up thinking they would run small."
PupSocks,2020-12-27T18:00:01Z,1,ordered over 1 month ago to secure kids their Christmas gift. but not receiving the products
PupSocks,2020-12-27T17:55:22Z,3,"The picture on the socks came out nice, but the socks themselves are not comfortable, they are stiff and don't have the 'bend', so they are uncomfortable :("
PupSocks,2020-12-27T17:54:39Z,2,"If I ever receive the product we ordered, might rate it higher. Not much of a xmas gift if it wasn’t here for xmas."
PupSocks,2020-12-27T17:51:38Z,1,"I'm giving one star, because there is no option for zero! When I placed my order, the website told me the production and shipping were fast. I placed my order on 11/29/20 by 12/4/20 I still had not received confirmation my order has been shipped out. I chatted with the company and was told they would ""refund 15% of my order for the delay and have my order sent out within 3-5 business days"". On December 12/9/20 I finally got a confirmation my order had shipped. My order FINALLY arrived on 12/18/20. My order arrived 19 days after I placed it. Oh but we're not done yet! When I opened my mailbox to get the long awaited personalized socks, it was an EMPTY BAG!! The post office stamped on it ""received empty"". I was livid! I reached out to customer service on 12/18, and it is now 12/27 and I still have not heard back from them. I WANT A REFUND! I will never order from you again, and I will post my review on all social media, and let everyone I know about this horrible experience. This was a Christmas gift for someone very special, and now they will not get it!"
PupSocks,2020-12-27T17:50:46Z,5,I love how the image came out on the socks and they were a big hit. The socks themselves are not very soft but we will wash them and see if they soften up.
PupSocks,2020-12-27T17:48:12Z,5,Socks are great quality. Absolutely love them. Best gift I gave this Christmas
PupSocks,2020-12-27T17:36:39Z,5,I ordered a pair of blue cat socks for my son who is away at grad school.  I thought it might make him laugh.  They are wonderful - very bright and the cat's face is exactly like the photo.  It's not blurry or faded.  I will definitely order these again.
PupSocks,2020-12-27T17:35:36Z,1,"I ordered a pair of socks on November 28th; well within their 8-10 day delivery promise for Christmas. Today is December 27th, and I am still waiting. They created a tracking number on Dec 9th, but my socks have yet to be taken to the post office. Every time I send an email inquiry, I get a canned response, blaming it on the post office. I don't know if this company is a total scam, or they are just in over way their heads, but I would never order from them again, and have requested a refund... and as for their affiliation with the Humane Society, that is simply not true. They have made a one time donation to the Humane Society."
PupSocks,2020-12-27T17:34:29Z,1,"Website said ships in 3 days, took over 2 weeks to ship. Ordered nov 26 and still haven't received order. Not even sure will receive order or if order will be correct."
PupSocks,2020-12-27T17:33:40Z,1,"I would love to leave a great review... but I still have not received a product. Although I can’t review the quality, my review is poor due to the amount of time it took to process this order, and how it was handled since. I’ve been waiting almost a month, and yes, this was a Christmas present. I had revived multiple updates stating these would arrive in time. It is now the 27th, and there is no longer an estimated date. I understand the shipping problems. What I don’t understand is why it took weeks to process/ship this order, and why I was promised delivery by Xmas. In either case, my experience has been poor so far, and I am now pretty embarrassed for not providing a gift."
PupSocks,2020-12-27T17:31:18Z,1,"I still don’t have the product, promised 11 days ago."
PupSocks,2020-12-27T17:29:54Z,5,These socks were a big hit at Christmas!  They were made of a weird fabric but no one seemed to notice.  Thanks!
PupSocks,2020-12-27T17:26:54Z,1,Ordered sock at the end of November and still have not received them.  The tracking app states they have been shipped but shows no status at all.  Sent messages to PupSocks with zero response.  Very disappointing.
PupSocks,2020-12-27T17:25:55Z,2,The quality is average.   Delivery took over 3 weeks. I will not order from them again.
PupSocks,2020-12-27T17:25:10Z,5,"Perfect gift for pet owners, perfect gift for those who have everything!  Great picture quality, time will tell on the materials.  And it arrived before Christmas. Great job all around by PupSocks!"
PupSocks,2020-12-27T17:21:54Z,3,"Ordered over 30 days ago, no tracking info update in over 10 days. There is nothing to review."
PupSocks,2020-12-27T17:19:43Z,1,Christmas gift was supposed to be shipped according to the tracking provided TWO WEEKS AGO!!  Have had zero movement with the package and have sent FOUR EMAILS ASKING FOR A REFUND WITH ZERO RESPONSE!!!  Do NOT BIY FROM THIS SCAM OF A COMPANY!!!!!  There is ZERO customer service and they just take your money and you never hear from them again!!!!!
PupSocks,2020-12-27T17:16:10Z,1,You never even shipped the item I ordered a month ago and you’re asking for a review?!  You should be put out of business!!  So many other people haven’t received their items either.  It’s a total scam!!  I will be filing with the BBB.
PupSocks,2020-12-27T17:15:59Z,4,"Product is ok, good, feel like could have been better quality however, I would recommend."
PupSocks,2020-12-27T17:15:41Z,5,"Received my order (socks) in a very timely manner, even with all of the holiday shipping delays. Item was exactly as expected."
PupSocks,2020-12-27T17:04:58Z,5,"The website was extremely easy to use, the uploaded pictures of our three cats faces came out perfectly on the socks. The socks are thick quality and arrived quicker than I had expected being the holidays. I crack up to the point of tears every time I look at the socks because the detail is so good you can see each of their facial expressions and personality!"
PupSocks,2020-12-27T17:04:28Z,5,"The Pupsocks exceeded my expectations!  More importantly, my wife, who loves our Goldendoodle dearly, immediately recognized her beloved Atticus.  She was overwhelmed and said it was the best gift ever!  Thank you Pupsocks for your attention to detail and for capturing Atticus’s image perfectly.  I have also ordered a blanket and will definitely be ordering more from Pupsocks in the future."
PupSocks,2020-12-27T17:03:38Z,1,"Bought two pairs of socks, but they sent wrong dogs face on them. Now, no response. Do not order from them, you won’t receive service."
PupSocks,2020-12-27T17:00:05Z,5,Great quality and super cute!
PupSocks,2020-12-27T16:59:12Z,1,If no star was an option that’s what I would give for a review.  I placed my order on 11/28 it is 12/27 and I still have not received an email that my order has even been mailed.  This is terrible customer service. I’m sure they will blame the shipping company.  I placed orders weeks after this with other company’s and I received them before Christmas.  Totally disappointed for the money!
PupSocks,2020-12-27T16:57:19Z,2,Did not come out as well as I thought. A lot of money for a pair of socks.
PupSocks,2020-12-27T16:53:13Z,4,"I ordered size L (Men’s 10-13) for my S.O. with size 10.5 feet. The socks were super adorable and feel nice, but unfortunately they are very tight and he had to struggle to put them on. This is very disappointing."
PupSocks,2020-12-27T16:52:20Z,5,"I think Pupsocks did a good job navigating what must have been unprecedented demand for their product this xmas season.  They kept in good communication with buyers, offered cancelation for those unable to wait, and gave discount codes for future purchases to those who could.  My socks arrived just in time for xmas but I was pleased to see that Pupsocks found a creative way to help other buyers who didn't get their socks in time -- the personalized digital postcards.  Thinking on their feet!  Which I appreciate in a small business.  I will be back!  And I am glad to see a GA business doing so well, by the way (GA deserves it after the important role it played in the election this year)!"
PupSocks,2020-12-27T16:49:56Z,4,"I bought a pair of socks as a Christmas gift for my girlfriend and she loves them!  They did a nice job printing the picture requested (and cropping it down) onto the sock, but she says the material that is used for the socks is kinda odd."
PupSocks,2020-12-27T16:48:41Z,1,I have not yet (December 27th) received the things I odered on  November 29th.
PupSocks,2020-12-27T16:47:46Z,1,"Wish I could give 0 stars...These are the second pair I have purchased the first pair was of my sons cat...I wasn't thrilled with that pair either, but thought I would give you guys another chance. This pair is even worse...practically not even recognizable as my friends dog  You should state if the animal has long hair you will chop it off...which then makes the animal look completely different. I even asked in the special instructions to not leave out the long hair.Don't waste your money on this product"
PupSocks,2020-12-27T16:44:45Z,1,"Terrible customer service, I placed my order 11-21 when I emailed to check the status. I was told there was no order found. As this was suppose to be a Xmas gift. Ugh, I finally received the blanket with completely different pets on 12-26. Not even close to what I submitted. Booo Pup Socks. Utterly disappointed."
PupSocks,2020-12-27T16:44:42Z,4,So cute. My sister loved the socks with her cat on them. The material seems a little weird.
PupSocks,2020-12-27T16:43:00Z,1,"Can't rate this higher than a 1, as I'm still waiting for my Christmas order on Dec 27 that I ordered Nov 20. Although I can understand time to ship here to Canada, but the Tracking feature shows absolutely nothing after Dec 4th in a Miami facility, until the 24th. Now it says it's here in Canada somewhere. Hey, I do get that December is a busy time for mailing items, but no tracking info over that 3 weeks span?  Really?? And there's no contact info for Customer Service, except email. So my first email inquiring about delays gets a form letter back saying they'll respond within 72 hours. A week later I send another email which got me an Auto-Reply saying they're overwhelmed by all the delays in shipping and delivering our orders.  Might have warned us of this on the website, folks. Still have not heard back from any Customer Service rep for 2 weeks.So far, I'm out $50 CDN with nothing to show for it."
PupSocks,2020-12-27T16:42:06Z,5,They where excellent. Thank you
PupSocks,2020-12-27T16:41:18Z,5,The socks were cuter than expected!
PupSocks,2020-12-27T16:40:18Z,4,"My kids LOVED the socks with the faces of our dog and cat!  The clarity of the photos was surprisingly good.  The texture of the socks was unexpected.  I am assuming that they are kind of ""slick"" due to the process that they must use to put the photos on the produce.  We are happy with the purchase."
PupSocks,2020-12-27T16:40:16Z,4,I had two pictures put on the socks I ordered... one image was very dark and the other looked purplish.
PupSocks,2020-12-27T16:38:57Z,4,Very cute socks.  My boys were very surprised and thought it was neat.
PupSocks,2020-12-27T16:37:57Z,5,These were amazing! We all loved them! I put them out as gifts from our rescue pup on her first Christmas.
PupSocks,2020-12-27T16:36:14Z,1,"I already wrote a review. But I’ll update. It’s been a month since I placed my order (11/28) and I haven’t gotten my blanket (still stuck in pre-shipment since 12/07)  and their automated bot emailed me to review their product. So, okay. 1 Star! I prefer 0. Thank God, I ordered through Amazon Pay and disputed my account. They gave me my FULL refund back within a week of the dispute. It took me 2-3 weeks to finally get hold of someone from Pupsocks. The guy I was emailing from Pupsocks said I would get my refund back minus $9 due to a “customization fee”. *eye roll* Don’t order from them. They are slow with customer service and keep pointing their fingers at USPS instead of taking accountability for their actions."
PupSocks,2020-12-27T16:35:17Z,1,Scam. Never received product. No refund. Bizarre emails from the company CEO blaming COVID for their issues despite these issues being widespread and documented by the Better Business Bureau long before COVID AVOID AVOID AVOID And Pupsocks: REFUND MY DAMN MONEY you never did anything but take my money and send me some emails
PupSocks,2020-12-27T16:28:38Z,1,"I ordered this product in November.  I was told 12-16 days for delivery international to Canada.I have sent several emails, Facebook messages and NO ONE has responded.  Christmas has come and gone and I had no gift for my Brother who suffers with depression after losing their pet and this gift was supposed to make him feel happy!!!I will not use this business again. 👎🏻"
PupSocks,2020-12-27T16:28:37Z,1,Socks are a terrible fit & material. Not cozy at all! My teenage  girls are both around 100 lbs and very slim. These socks are huge on their feet but like compression socks around their calves. Very tight. They can’t wear them comfortably. Very disappointed in this product after debating about the cost for several weeks.
PupSocks,2020-12-27T16:27:06Z,1,"I ordered 4 pet blankets on November 28th and got notification they were “in production” on November 29th.  As of December 27th I’ve received no blankets or any further updates.  I’ve emailed 3 times and only received a response the first time that, while a prompt response, did not provide details specific to my orders. These were Christmas gifts for my 4 kids that I was very excited to give.  I wonder when it if they’ll ever ship out and show up?"
PupSocks,2020-12-27T16:25:58Z,5,My friend loved these! They arrived timely and communication was good! Reliable site!
PupSocks,2020-12-27T16:25:35Z,1,"What a horrible experience, ordered a full month before Christmas and still now 2 days after Christmas I have not received. The communication is non-existent right from the beginning, just horrible."
PupSocks,2020-12-27T16:23:48Z,5,These socks are high quality as well as the photos on the socks! My husband and mom loved them!
PupSocks,2020-12-27T16:19:56Z,5,Awesome Product!! I ordered the Blanket for a Christmas gift and it arrived on time and is perfect!! The recipient loved it and the artwork is excellent!! Great job!!
PupSocks,2020-12-27T16:18:59Z,1,"Placed my order November 29 and as of December 27, I still have not received my order.  Yes I know there's a pandemic and along with the holiday shipping was affected BUT that is why I placed the order so extra early.  Not impressed with service.  No idea of the quality of the order since I haven't received it."
PupSocks,2020-12-27T16:16:16Z,4,"This blanket was an absolutely delightful gift for our 13 year-old son, who adores our cat. The printing was excellent, but the blanket is pretty thin for the price, and made in China (printed in USA). I didn't see a cat version of the blanket available, so the blanket I ordered with our cat's face on it has bones on it, LOL. A cat blanket option similar to the cat socks option would be great!"
PupSocks,2020-12-27T16:16:14Z,1,"Order not delivered.  Order placed on November 29th.  Money was accepted.  A 5-10 business days promised delivery.   Still have not received my order as of December 27th.  This was a Christmas gift.   Reached out several times via PupSocks email system... no direct response... no notification from this company... extremely disappointing,  will never do business with them again."
PupSocks,2020-12-27T16:15:27Z,5,Very satisfied with socks.  Pictures came out great.Website easy to work with.  Delivery was prompt.Would recommend this product to others.Thank you.
PupSocks,2020-12-27T16:13:48Z,5,I’m very pleased with the blanket! The images of our dog’s face are clear and the blanket is very soft.
PupSocks,2020-12-27T16:10:24Z,5,We purchased pup socks for our dog loving adult children and ourselves and put them in all of our stockings for Christmas. Everyone was thrilled! The order took about 10 days to receive and all 7 pairs of socks looked great! We would order again and probably will for another occasion and for friends!
PupSocks,2020-12-27T16:08:46Z,1,"I placed a Christmas order on Nov 20th. The socks that arrived featured someone else's dog. After sending 2 emails to the bark department, I finally received a response that my order would be corrected (Dec 15). As of Dec 27th, tracking information shows a label was created on Dec 21st, but nothing has shipped. So the order was incorrect, customer response was slow, Christmas was missed, and product has still not arrived. Not OK."
PupSocks,2020-12-27T16:07:12Z,1,"A month after ordering, still haven’t received them, and we are 2 days after Christmas.... Very disappointed!"
PupSocks,2020-12-27T16:06:36Z,1,"Ordered socks in November. Xmas has passed and I was unable to give my present.COVID-19 makes things harder, but you were given more than enough time."
PupSocks,2020-12-27T16:02:39Z,5,My son loves his socks!
PupSocks,2020-12-27T16:01:18Z,1,"Ordered on 11/29.  All verbiage hinted that it would ship within 8 days.  Never arrived in time for Christmas (as of 12/27 - still not here) - and the response time from their Customer Service was several days. Only a $30 expense, but not a good experience overall so far."
PupSocks,2020-12-27T15:59:30Z,1,"Received order, but picture is printed incorrectly. It's a mirror-image so the markings on the cats face are reversed. I emailed to have the order corrected and keep receiving the dreaded MAILER-DAEMON failure to deliver reply in return. Not sure what to do except leave my review everywhere I can on social media to warn others to stay away from this ill-run company."
PupSocks,2020-12-27T15:59:09Z,5,"So far, I have two blankets from PupSocks and they are the cutest things ever! What could be better than having the face of my little Lucy princess on blankets! They are the perfect size for Lucy and me to snuggle on the couch. And they are incredibly soft."
PupSocks,2020-12-27T15:54:46Z,5,"I first thought the socks were a bit expensive, but when I saw the quality I understood. Color is bright, picture is clear the socks are definitely well constructed and high quality!"
PupSocks,2020-12-27T15:52:44Z,1,I never received either item I ordered back in November. It is now 12/27/20.
PupSocks,2020-12-27T15:49:32Z,1,"Ordered socks over a month ago as a Christmas present.  Still have not received them.  Would not recommend.  Probably are stuck on a barge in the middle of the Atlantic, if they are anywhere at all."
PupSocks,2020-12-27T15:48:46Z,5,"The socks came out wonderfully, no complaints!"
PupSocks,2020-12-27T15:48:00Z,5,"I ordered these socks as a gift for my husband. They came out cuter than I expected and he really likes them. I’ve washed them twice so far, inside out, and they look good as new with no fading. I posted a pic of them on social media and received many compliments. I would order these again!"
PupSocks,2020-12-27T15:48:00Z,1,Still have not received my order. This is my second email and have not heard anything in return. Not great service.
PupSocks,2020-12-27T15:44:12Z,5,We gave three pairs of Pup Socks to our relatives for Christmas & they absolutely loved them. Thanks for making me the most popular gift giver. 🧑‍🎄
PupSocks,2020-12-27T15:43:29Z,1,I still haven’t received this after a month. No clue when I should expect it. Tracking said waiting to be picked up for shipments for two weeks.
PupSocks,2020-12-27T15:42:13Z,3,The socks look good with the photo.  They are a bit too long in length. But if they were smaller I think they would be too tight.  They aren’t very comfortable or like traditional socks.  Overall more like a gag gift than socks you would want to actually wear.  I would not purchase again.
PupSocks,2020-12-27T15:40:41Z,5,Excellent high quality materials that had the cutest pic of our fur baby in them!  A highly recommended product!! You will love them!!
PupSocks,2020-12-27T15:38:54Z,1,"Socks were not made correctly.  Sent an email to ask how to handle, no response!"
PupSocks,2020-12-27T15:38:44Z,4,"The recipient of the socks was delighted to see them and put them on right away. She loved wearing them to show off her puppy, but said they felt/fit weird- she has large feet. Other than that, they were very solidly made and arrived in time, the day before Christmas Eve."
PupSocks,2020-12-27T15:37:42Z,3,"The images were nice but the socks were not comfortable. Also, I ordered these on 11/29 as a Christmas gift but did not receive them until 12/26. It was a bit surprising that it took so long for production and shipping, especially since I’m so close to Atlanta, where they were made."
PupSocks,2020-12-27T15:35:32Z,1,Can't review socks bec I have not received them. Ordered November 30th.Today is December 27th. Thought I would have plenty of time to get them before Christmas.
PupSocks,2020-12-27T15:35:28Z,5,I purchased these for my son for Christmas!  He lives them
PupSocks,2020-12-27T15:34:21Z,5,Very cute!  One of the best Christmas gifts!
PupSocks,2020-12-27T15:33:58Z,1,Wouldn’t know how they are......haven’t arrived after 6 weeks.....😒
PupSocks,2020-12-27T15:33:57Z,5,Beautiful product. Kept well informed of its progress.
PupSocks,2020-12-27T15:33:18Z,5,they look great and are a perfect gift
PupSocks,2020-12-27T15:32:41Z,1,I can’t write an honest review because I have yet to receive my order. Was supposed to be Christmas gifts for my parents but that didn’t happen. Disappointed.
PupSocks,2020-12-27T15:29:52Z,1,You sent a pair of socks that were not even of my dogs
PupSocks,2020-12-27T15:27:17Z,3,You need to use packaging without plastic poking holes through them to hold them together.  There was a hole in my sons sock that caused a pull.  And they are way too expensive to get them with holes and pulls in them.
PupSocks,2020-12-27T15:27:08Z,5,"The blanket is AWESOME!! So soft, perfect adult size, picture came out perfect!!!"
PupSocks,2020-12-27T15:26:30Z,1,"In one word, Horrible. I waited almost three weeks to get socks that were supposed to have photos of my three cats. Instead I get a pair that suspiciously looks like the dog socks in their ad. I immediately emailed back. It’s been close to a week and I haven’t heard anything. But it is the Christmas holiday. However others have also had this problem because there is a Facebook site related to what they feel is a Pupsocks ripoff. So this wasn’t a one time mistake. “Pupsocks or Pupscam” is the title of the Facebook group."
PupSocks,2020-12-27T15:20:59Z,1,Still have no received my order. Have emailed the company twice and they sent me a “sneak peak” of my order which is wrong. I emailed them about that as well and still have not heard anything back
PupSocks,2020-12-27T15:18:52Z,5,Ordered 3 pairs for Christmas! My brothers love them!
PupSocks,2020-12-27T15:18:48Z,3,The socks looked cute but they are a very weird material and very big. Not soft at all they are like hospital socks.
PupSocks,2020-12-27T15:18:48Z,1,"It is very hard to review something that still has not arrived!!!!  I ordered these a month ago and they still are not here, now Christmas has come and gone!!!!So disappointed that my family did not have them in their Stockings Xmas morning.  I have no idea when they will arrive!"
PupSocks,2020-12-27T15:18:43Z,1,I am so disappointed in what I received. I ordered kid size. What I received is huge and way too big for a kid. Plus the sock itself is like one large shapeless tube. It has no place for a heel. I can’t believe what crappy quality they are. The face of is cheap too. I ordered on Nov 28 and got them dec 24. A whole month! I had many other options on where to order and I wish I would’ve. I was so excited to give these to my little boy. I want my money back.
PupSocks,2020-12-27T15:17:18Z,1,"I ordered 3 socks for White Elephant grab bag presents. They were ordered on Nov. 28th. The company contacted me on Dec. 12th to say that an error had occurred, they apologize, and my order is now being processed. I understand that mistakes happen but ZERO attempt was made to expedite the shipping and get this order to me on the day I needed them (the 19th - not Christmas). I find this to be extremely poor customer service when there is an admitted error on the company's part. My socks never arrived until the 24th - too late! This cost me both time and money! The printing is great but the socks are poor fitting. They bunch up at the ankles are very wide. In my book, they are strictly for a joke and a little on the expensive side for that!"
PupSocks,2020-12-27T15:14:48Z,5,Perfect! We love them!
PupSocks,2020-12-27T15:14:20Z,1,"The quality of the socks is TERRIBLE.  They are way too big, too stiff, and not comfortable at all.  The face mask is also VERY INADEQUATE in size and not worth the money.  I am very disappointed..."
PupSocks,2020-12-27T15:12:58Z,5,What a memorable item for my grandson who’s chihuahua is 13 years old now! 🥰
PupSocks,2020-12-27T15:12:20Z,1,"I submitted a photo of my dog to create custom socks and received the completely wrong order (not my dog, not even the correct color). To make it worse, they never responded to my notification about the problem with my order or request for a refund."
PupSocks,2020-12-27T15:11:49Z,5,I got them as a Christmas gift and they turned out amazing!! Definitely recommend for anyone that is dog obsessed as we are!
PupSocks,2020-12-27T15:10:55Z,4,"Products look great. I was disappointed in how long it took for my products to arrive. The initial email I received when I placed my order said I would receive my order in 8-10 business days, but it did not ship for over 3 weeks. In fact, I received an email that my order had shipped, but when I tracked it I could see that the shipping label was printed but it did not actually ship for a few more days. But, I did get my items in time for Christmas which was great. Certainly I understand that this is a busy time for orders, but I feel like production took longer than expected. I think people are understanding of how long the process takes but it would be great to know up front how long it will take to receive your items."
PupSocks,2020-12-27T15:08:29Z,1,Ordered on Nov 28th for a Christmas present. Still have received them. They sent a printout if the socks instead.  Not the same when opening presents. Very disappointed.
PupSocks,2020-12-27T15:06:57Z,5,Great socks! They cropped the cats' faces perfectly and the socks fit as expected
PupSocks,2020-12-27T15:06:21Z,1,Still haven’t received the correct socks yet.....
PupSocks,2020-12-27T15:06:01Z,5,I bought these as a gift and they were a huge hit! My friend LOVED them and has not taken them off in days. Great product and I will be buying more!
PupSocks,2020-12-27T15:05:59Z,4,Socks were great but was a little unimpressed that they took almost a month to get here which made the Christmas present late.
PupSocks,2020-12-27T15:05:56Z,5,Love the socks!
PupSocks,2020-12-27T15:02:48Z,3,"The socks looked like I expected them to, but the quality of the sock is much lower."
PupSocks,2020-12-27T15:01:46Z,1,"Ordered on Nov 29, shipped Dec 18, we had already left home on a trip. V disappointed they weren't here in time for our Christmas."
PupSocks,2020-12-27T15:01:29Z,1,Still have not received my order. Emailed for a refund and CEO responded they were sorry and someone would get in contact with me and that was last week. Still no response and no offer of a refund.
PupSocks,2020-12-27T14:58:36Z,5,"Purchased six pairs, each with a different face.  Perfect pictures and the recipients were delighted.Many questions on where I purchased; I suspect friends and family of these recipients will be recipients next year!!"
PupSocks,2020-12-27T14:56:06Z,1,"I ordered 11/28 for a Christmas gift, and it was not even shipped until 12/23!  I sent 2 emails (there is no phone number) and no one got back to me.  It is now 12-27 and I still don’t have the gift.  I will never order from this company again.  Very disappointing."
PupSocks,2020-12-27T14:55:22Z,5,The pup socks were a big hit! They arrived on time and look great! Definitely would buy again.
PupSocks,2020-12-27T14:53:49Z,4,"I received my socks and a 20% discount for the delay, thanks!"
PupSocks,2020-12-27T14:46:33Z,5,Gave these as a gift for my girls and the quality and the picture are amazing!  They loved them!
PupSocks,2020-12-27T14:43:42Z,1,My order did not arrive before Christmas though I ordered in November. Do not order these unless you have a LONG lead time.
PupSocks,2020-12-27T14:41:00Z,5,we recently lost a cat and this was a great gift to remember him by
PupSocks,2020-12-27T14:40:41Z,1,Ordered a blanket with photo of bunnies and they added dog bones and paws to it. Waste of a lot of Money. Why don’t they send a preview of what it’s going to look like? Didn’t anyone look at and figure out it was wrong? Extremely disappointed. Had to go spend more money for a new present.
PupSocks,2020-12-27T14:40:02Z,3,"The socks are cut in a weird straight way that makes them too tight on the top of the foot when you try to actually wear them. There’s a bit of elastic there but it’s not enough to be comfortable for a larger foot (and I got a men’s xl).  Sorry, they’re cute but not really functional at all."
PupSocks,2020-12-27T14:40:01Z,1,I understand it was busier than usual with Covid but my order took two weeks before it was processed and then it ended up being late for Xmas despite giving myself several weeks for it to arrive in time. I ask numerous times for a tracking number and all I received back was a mass generated email from the “CEO and founder” stating how busy you guys were and never received a legit response. And no... I still haven’t received my mask and socks... I overpaid for these items because it was xmas and I still haven’t received them...
PupSocks,2020-12-27T14:38:27Z,4,"These socks are so cute, and the person that received them loved them. I just wish they had been sent in time for Christmas."
PupSocks,2020-12-27T14:38:19Z,2,"It’s been a month since I placed my order for Christmas gifts and there still isn’t a delivery date in sight. Slow service and no Christmas gifts to share on Christmas morning, let’s just say I’m not thrilled."
PupSocks,2020-12-27T14:37:17Z,3,"The socks were really cute, however their shape is very awkward. The foot area is huge and the calf area is tiny. My daughter loved them, but I’m not sure she’s going to be able to wear them."
PupSocks,2020-12-27T14:35:25Z,5,Socks are great! Pictures of dogs are very clear.
PupSocks,2020-12-27T14:32:48Z,5,They were even better than I expected!!!  They were the favorite gifts at Christmas!!!
PupSocks,2020-12-27T14:31:53Z,2,The socks are not wearable at all. They are not shaped like a sock. The leg part is too tight and the foot part is way too wide for anyone to wear. The material is of poor quality. The picture did turn out perfect but very disappointed in the quality of the product.
PupSocks,2020-12-27T14:31:13Z,2,Photos were fine and came on time but the material of the socks is awful.  They feel like rubber.  I don’t know who would want to put these on their feet.  Very disappointing.
PupSocks,2020-12-27T14:29:59Z,5,I appreciated the quality of the socks especially the dog’s photo. The receiver of the socks told me I killed it and they were awesome. So thank you very much
PupSocks,2020-12-27T14:27:59Z,1,"I ordered the pup socks after seeing an add, advertising the product as a potential Christmas present. I thought, seeing as though there was a month until Christmas and that they’re suggesting it as a gift for the upcoming occasion, that I would order a few pairs! Well they still haven’t arrived yet and Christmas has passed... interesting that I would get an email from you this morning asking me to review a product I have yet to receive! I hope you don’t advertise these in the future as a potential Christmas gift and that if you can’t print the product and ship it in a timely manner then you’re in the wrong business!"
PupSocks,2020-12-27T14:26:41Z,1,I ordered my pup socks over a month ago as a Christmas gift and they haven’t arrived yet.
PupSocks,2020-12-27T14:20:49Z,1,"Received the socks that I ordered and was sooo disappointed when I gifted them to my grandson who is a cancer survivor.  THEY WERE WAAAYYYY TOO LONG IN THE FOOT AND WAAAYYYY TOO TIGHT IN THE LEGS TO EVEN GET ON.  He is 11 years old!  I cannot tell you how bad I felt for him, as his eyes lit up when he originally opened the package and saw his pup's face.    I ordered a woman's medium, I believe.  I am a medium woman and I could not even begin to get them on.  The stretch is just not there.  Really?  I am just a mess over this.  Poor choice of fabric for these.  SMH.  The pup's face and the color of the socks were spot on, though!  Keep trying!"
PupSocks,2020-12-27T14:20:21Z,5,Easy ordering process and socks came out perfect. I would definitely recommend
PupSocks,2020-12-27T14:15:45Z,5,They are absolutely adorable!!!! I ordered two pairs and they are both awesome!!!!
PupSocks,2020-12-27T14:14:34Z,1,I ordered my socks for my fiance on November 29th believing that they would arrive before Christmas. It's now the 27th and they still have not arrived. Your site gave no indication that I needed to do anything like upgrade shipping to ensure that they arrived by Christmas. I'm very disappointed.
PupSocks,2020-12-27T14:14:04Z,5,Perfect & just as described!
PupSocks,2020-12-27T14:13:46Z,1,No deliveryUs price
PupSocks,2020-12-27T14:09:54Z,5,Got both of my daughters a pair of pupsocks with my dogs face and it's one of the favorite Christmas gifts they got ! Not only are they super cute but they are good quality socks as well .
PupSocks,2020-12-27T14:09:17Z,4,The socks look great.  The picture came out purrfect.  A great gift idea.  The socks are oddly sized.  I wish they had a little better design.  Makes them somewhat of just a novelty gift.
PupSocks,2020-12-27T14:07:58Z,4,So fun! The material is a little different but the pics of my dog plastered all over them makes up for it.
PupSocks,2020-12-27T14:07:39Z,3,Didn’t follow my instructions on how to crop the image. Also the quality of the socks are mediocre.
PupSocks,2020-12-27T14:05:44Z,1,I haven’t received my order yet. I sent in on Dec 2. It was for a Christmas gift.
PupSocks,2020-12-27T14:04:59Z,1,I ordered one pair of socks on 12/6 and I still have not gotten them (it’s 12/27 today). Their estimated processing and shipping times are inaccurate and misleading. I was hoping to have them for Christmas.
PupSocks,2020-12-27T14:04:32Z,5,"Love it, great Christmas gift!"
PupSocks,2020-12-27T14:00:19Z,1,"Use a different company this one is not worth the headache.One of the worst experiences ordering online. It’s now been over a month and I haven’t seen the product I ordered. I ordered similar products from other companies and received them in 2 weeks. They blame it on covid, but I’m pretty sure it’s a computer that prints them so they are just trying to find excuses, I order on Black Friday and didn’t get an communication until I hounded then with emails. Nothing for 2 weeks. Also customer service was very rude and useless. Emailed a number of times and only after the 4th email did I hear anything.  Than they told me that because I was an international order I wasn’t their priority before Christmas. Honestly one of the worst experience ordering online and I can’t even review the products as it’s been over a month and have nothing. If you want to order custom sock or such go elsewhere it’s not worth the headache of this company."
PupSocks,2020-12-27T13:54:32Z,2,"I was extremely disappointed in my order. The pictures and colors were great but the socks were a terrible quality and the material was so weird. None of my family members will wear them.  They are heavy and a strange non sock material.  Not a normal soft sock at all.  Biggest gift disappointment, I was so bummed."
PupSocks,2020-12-27T13:49:49Z,5,The socks I had made for my husband were a huge hit! They had our cat and dogs face on them.  He said best gift he’s ever gotten!
PupSocks,2020-12-27T13:47:36Z,1,"Wrong image printed on sock. Chose the multiple cat image (3 cats) from 2 photos. One photo had two cats, the other photo had one cat. They didn’t print both cats from the one image just duplicated one of the cats."
PupSocks,2020-12-27T13:44:24Z,1,I never received my order. I tried emailing multiple times to find out what was going on. Nobody responded and I still have not be refunded. Disgusted by the customer service. The problem was not with the carrier. The tracking says the information was sent to them but no goods were given to the carrier to deliver
PupSocks,2020-12-27T13:44:23Z,4,Huge socks and weird material but great result
PupSocks,2020-12-27T13:31:46Z,5,Bought a pair for my stepdad for Christmas from my dog and it was a hit! He loves them!
PupSocks,2020-12-27T13:23:18Z,1,Package arrived empty. No customer service response from you
PupSocks,2020-12-27T13:05:00Z,1,"Still haven’t received order placed Nov 27th. So, I would not recommend."
PupSocks,2020-12-27T13:04:14Z,2,"The picture on the socks came out great BUT the socks themselves didn’t even resemble a sock. Very flat, no defined heel. Looked very cheap in quality. I’m hoping it’s just due to the ironing I guess if the image so hoping a wash and dry will help but currently not pleased at all."
PupSocks,2020-12-27T13:03:33Z,5,Socks arrived on time and pictures used were well edited!
PupSocks,2020-12-27T13:00:19Z,2,"The quality of the sock material is so thin, I can see through it. For that price I  would expect a thicker material. The picture of my dog.is also a bit blurry. Very disappointed."
PupSocks,2020-12-27T12:45:42Z,1,"It took like 3 weeks to get a mediocre, low quality product that was supposed to take 3-5 days."
PupSocks,2020-12-27T12:33:07Z,4,"Great concept. The cat face on my socks was cropped which was expected, but it really changed the look of the fluffy cat we have."
PupSocks,2020-12-27T12:21:55Z,1,"Their website falsely promised orders made before December 12th would arrive by Christmas. I placed my order on December 8th, Christmas has come and gone-still haven’t received my order. The only way to contact customer  service is virtually and you will only get a generic response in return. At this point all I can review is their marketing-false promises and horrid customer service. (Their website posts Trustpilot reviews but only 4&5 star.)"
PupSocks,2020-12-27T12:13:13Z,3,"Great picture, but socks were uncomfortable."
PupSocks,2020-12-27T12:08:41Z,5,"Easy, fast shipping and a favorite gift that will be remembered for years to come!"
PupSocks,2020-12-27T12:02:58Z,5,The socks looked great!! Love them!!
PupSocks,2020-12-27T09:56:02Z,5,Very nicely done. Pictures well trimmed and look nice.
PupSocks,2020-12-27T08:40:12Z,5,They were perfect!
PupSocks,2020-12-27T08:15:16Z,5,"We loved the socks, they are excellent gifts. Took a bit longer than expected to get to Singapore but we were very pleased with them and will be ordering more!"
PupSocks,2020-12-27T08:14:51Z,5,the socks turned out super cute ! A great gift for my uber picky 22 yr old son who expresses himself through socks :) Very nice quality
PupSocks,2020-12-27T07:27:29Z,1,"I placed my order almost a month ago, and still have not received it. I have contacted this company about it multiple times asking them to cancel my order since it is taking so long, and have not received anything but an auto generated response. There is no phone number listed anywhere on their website for me to call and actually speak to a person about it, which leads me to strongly suspect this business is a scam."
PupSocks,2020-12-27T07:20:29Z,1,My order was never received and customer service is not responsive. Very disappointing as this was meant for a gift.
PupSocks,2020-12-27T06:15:42Z,4,"My family loved the socks. The images and colours were just as I expected. I was just a bit surprised by the overall finish/texture of the socks, which I felt didn’t show up in your website pictures."
PupSocks,2020-12-27T06:03:00Z,5,Exactly what I expected them to be. No issues at all. Awesome.
PupSocks,2020-12-27T05:08:32Z,1,They are silky (weird fabric/finish) with no stretch at all. There’s no place for your heel so bunches tightly at the front of the ankle. Complete waste of $30. I bought two different pairs as gifts and both were not able to wear. The graphic of the photo was cute but I could’ve had a picture printed for that. Very disappointing😔😔
PupSocks,2020-12-27T05:04:24Z,1,"I have sent 4 emails regarding the incorrect order that was sent to me and what will be done to fix it. The first response I received stated I would be contacted in 48hours. Well that time frame came & went and on my 4th email I received a response blaming the mail for order delays. I’m not complaining about my order being on time, I’m complaining because I didn’t receive even close to what I paid for!!! I uploaded a picture of a DOG to be on a pink sock. I received a CAT on a blue sock. So again I ask: where are the socks that I ordered? And how is this blatant disregard for customer satisfaction even remotely ok?"
PupSocks,2020-12-27T05:04:17Z,5,My wife loved her present!  The blanket and the socks were both great quality...
PupSocks,2020-12-27T05:03:30Z,5,"This was a personalized blanket with our daughters cat image on it - given as a Christmas gift.  The shipment arrived on time as promised, the blanket was good quality and our daughter LOVED it!!  She cried when she opened the package.  She’s 20 years old, and said that this was her BEST Christmas ever!!Thanks PupSocks!!"
PupSocks,2020-12-27T04:43:47Z,1,"I placed an order for a pair of child sized socks with our dog’s face on 25 November to use as a stocking stuffer.  On December 5, I received a pair of large woman's/men’s socks with the face of someone else’s dog.  Although I was very disappointed with the quality of the socks (see comments following), I immediately contacted the company via email for a replacement.  After not receiving any response, on December 7, I used the PupSocks online chat option and dialogued with a representative who was actually very helpful in resubmitting my order right away and sending email confirmation of the reorder.  Unfortunately, the replacement was not processed to ship until December 14 via USPS.  Even though it was shipped from just one state over, due to the clogged mail system, it did not arrive until December 26.  The quality of these socks are subpar compared to similar ones I’d purchased from a different company in the past.  Aside from the fact that the replacement pair are enormous and do not fit my 12 year old child (they fit my husband’s size 10 feet), they are virtually shapeless and made of thin, stiff material."
PupSocks,2020-12-27T04:32:04Z,5,I love these socks! So cute!
PupSocks,2020-12-27T04:24:04Z,3,"I was very disappointed with the production & delivery timeline. While I fully understand the potential holiday delivery delays, I ordered my two items on 11/27 and just received them today on 12/26. There were Christmas gifts, so it's very frustrating to have not received them in time to give as such."
PupSocks,2020-12-27T04:10:09Z,5,They were perfect!  Loved them.
PupSocks,2020-12-27T03:59:33Z,1,"These socks are not wearable.They feel extremely tight, rough and uncomfortable. The picture quality is great, but the socks are not for wearing."
PupSocks,2020-12-27T03:54:52Z,1,"The PupSocks ad depicts socks with a very clearly printed photo of a dog/cat. I was disappointed with my purchase. I sent a clear photo of a black lab but the photo on my order looked so faded (more like a gray lab) that my SIL did not recognize it was a photo of his own dog. Definitely would not order again. Gave them one star because the ordering process and time frame for getting the order delivered was as expected.  However, the photo on the socks was the main attraction and it failed to meet expectations. Money wasted."
PupSocks,2020-12-27T03:47:10Z,5,Fast delivery and better then expected results! Loved the socks
PupSocks,2020-12-27T03:29:19Z,5,Very well made! These socks were an absolute hit! I would define li suggest ordering from here for cute customer puppy items!
PupSocks,2020-12-27T03:25:56Z,1,I ordered socks for my daughter with her dog on them. I received socks with 3 cats on them. I contacted customer service and have not heard anything from them. Not happy at all with Pupsocks
PupSocks,2020-12-27T03:22:25Z,1,"These socks are a gag gift. No one would ever actually wear them,I’m very disappointed in the quality"
PupSocks,2020-12-27T03:09:17Z,1,Slow shipping.  They sent me the proof supposedly after the product shipped.  They really don't have there game together.  I would not order from them.  I won't again.
PupSocks,2020-12-27T03:06:23Z,1,I was extremely unhappy with the socks I ordered for my Daughter for Christmas. The socks were not comfortable had no shape and she put them on one time and they completely stretched out I am definitely hoping to get a refund
PupSocks,2020-12-27T03:01:48Z,2,"Love the photos on the socks, However,  the socks themselves are not wearable. They are basically a rectangle that do not fit anyone."
PupSocks,2020-12-27T02:58:35Z,5,Still waiting on the correct order! :)Edit 2/9/21: Received the correct order and they are WONDERFUL!
PupSocks,2020-12-27T02:57:40Z,1,I ordered over a month ago and my order still has not arrived. Customer service has not been helpful.
PupSocks,2020-12-27T02:53:26Z,3,I love the idea of these but the material is not stretchy at all and we’re very snug. I understand that the material has to be printed on so may that is a reason they are so thin but the sizing seems small.
PupSocks,2020-12-27T02:44:02Z,5,"Super cute socks! We used a friend’s granddaughter as the picture, and they turned out great! The picture was clear & adorable! I Would definitely buy from this place again."
PupSocks,2020-12-27T02:42:05Z,1,I ordered a pair of socks on November 28 and it is today December 26 and I still don’t have them and do not know where they are. There is no number to contact anybody and I have not received an email response
PupSocks,2020-12-27T02:37:56Z,5,Purrfect gift and came in time for Christmas !
PupSocks,2020-12-27T02:35:46Z,1,Very disappointed with these socks The picture makes it look like they are high quality.  They are not. Image printed is not very clear. For about $30 for a pair they are way overpriced.  We will not be ordering any more
PupSocks,2020-12-27T02:31:25Z,5,I purchased these as a Christmas gift for my son in law. He is a Marine ready to retire next year. He was thrilled with the socks with his beloved “Maggie” on them and said they are so soft! A proud Marine loving his new socks.
PupSocks,2020-12-27T02:24:18Z,5,"PupSocks is an *INCREDIBLE* company!*Incredibly awful* Placed order on 11/28 with a guarantee to receive in time for Christmas. Still have not received the product. Reached out to customer service on 12/23, received a generic auto-response but still no real response with any answers. Pupsocks has my money and I don’t have my order or answers. Very disappointed. Save your money and just don’t order from the company.Update: 1/22/21After multiple attempts to try and contact PupSocks, they finally got back to me 18 days after my first attempt. In their response, they completely ignored my request for a refund and automatically submitted a replacement order. I received an email saying that the replacement order shipped on January 12 and to allow up to 5 business days to allow UPSP to sort and scan the package. As of today, USPS has not received the package that supposedly shipped over a week ago. I am still waiting to hear back from someone from the PupSocks Team regarding the replacement order but am not holding my breath. In the meantime, I have filed a dispute with my bank for a refund and also a complaint with the BBB.Save your time and more importantly, your hard earned cash money and DO NOT order from this extremely unprofessional and heinous company."
PupSocks,2020-12-27T02:19:55Z,4,Socks are beautiful!    One star lost for the long wait - 5 weeks.   I would order again in future but make sure I can allow lots of time for shipping.
PupSocks,2020-12-27T02:16:00Z,5,Love them! My gf was so excited and put them on right away!
PupSocks,2020-12-27T02:15:34Z,1,I can’t rate this product because it still hasn’t arrived. The delay on this order and lack of communication is not reasonable.
PupSocks,2020-12-27T02:13:26Z,5,Best gift ever! This is the second time I have ordered Pup Socks and the pure joy on my daughters faces when they got this gift on Christmas morning was priceless!
PupSocks,2020-12-27T02:02:42Z,5,They're perfect!
PupSocks,2020-12-27T01:56:36Z,1,"I am thoroughly disappointed with this company and their service. I ordered my socks on November 27, 2020 and only get responses that say they blame UPS for the delay.... I have no idea where my $30 pair of socks are and they have avoided all of my inquires. Never use again or recommend."
PupSocks,2020-12-27T01:53:32Z,5,These socks turned out great! The picture is super clear and they were a big hit as a Christmas present. Highly recommended!
PupSocks,2020-12-27T01:52:57Z,1,I sent socks to friend. It was suppose to have their cats face but they got socks with pups on them.
PupSocks,2020-12-27T01:51:22Z,5,Love love love these socks.  Got both of my kids a pair with our two pups on them.  Spot on!! Going to order a pair for my husband!!
PupSocks,2020-12-27T01:48:12Z,4,A fun gift! The pictures came out really well! They do run a little big. The foot part also seems a little wide - it was bunchy for both my sister and husband.
PupSocks,2020-12-27T01:38:32Z,1,The socks seem cheap.  They were also too big.
PupSocks,2020-12-27T01:38:07Z,1,"I would like to be able to rate you a zero, but that's not an option.I ordered from you in Nov for a gift, for Christmas. Today is Dec 26th, no delivery, hasn't even left the states.Won't order from you ever again, and will warn people about your shipping time."
PupSocks,2020-12-27T01:32:12Z,5,I love the socks. They are so cute and warm! Would definitely recommend!
PupSocks,2020-12-27T01:28:15Z,1,I ordered the sock over a month ago and still have not received them. Actually thinking about canceling the order and getting a refund. The shipping updates show that it has been in transit for the last three weeks.
PupSocks,2020-12-27T01:26:04Z,5,Great work! And fast shipping!!
PupSocks,2020-12-27T01:24:11Z,1,"I understand  the long wait time but lousy product that came without gift wrap that I paid extra for. I saw the warning too late, there is a Facebook page just for people to vent.I have learned not to purchase products off Facebook."
PupSocks,2020-12-27T01:23:08Z,3,Ordered 2 different blankets the day after Thanksgiving and both arrived the day before Christmas so was happy about that.   The quality of one looked great and the other was so so.  2 of the 3 pics on one were darker than what I submitted and difficult to see.  The 4 pics on the others turned out well.
PupSocks,2020-12-27T01:15:01Z,2,"The order still hasn’t arrived as of Dec 26. Ordered November 28th. Have not been updated on shipping issues until after my expected delivery date had passed and I found this information out on the Facebook platform. Why not more than 2 stars? Your job is to deliver online stuff. I still don’t have my stuff. You did a promo to lock me in to a purchase, but did not meet expectations. Why not 1 star? I’m slightly sympathetic, and you sent me a link which captured the gift in an image, but it’s hardly the real thing, though smart strategy. You’ve got a lot of things to do to improve. Don’t say 5-20 days for international if that is outside your control. Tell it how it is. I would NOT have ordered from you if I knew this was not going to arrive on time, and I feel generous with a two star rating."
PupSocks,2020-12-27T01:14:38Z,1,I have reached out to your company 5 times now and no return of communication yet!! My order was wrong!! It was supposed to be a Christmas gift too! I was so excited to give this too! Hoping I hear back AND this can be fixed!! Especially since it’s paid for!!ThanksAndrea Miller
PupSocks,2020-12-27T01:13:44Z,1,If i could rate them a 0 i would. SCAM COMPANY DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!
PupSocks,2020-12-27T01:06:36Z,5,Perfect cutting and cropping to get exactly what I wanted on our socks! This is my third pair purchased and I absolutely love them all!
PupSocks,2020-12-27T00:58:08Z,1,It's been about a month and still didn't receive anything! Not happy
PupSocks,2020-12-27T00:54:17Z,5,Fast service. Great quality. Pictures were very accurate.
PupSocks,2020-12-27T00:47:40Z,1,Still haven’t gotten my order after nearly 4 weeks!!
PupSocks,2020-12-27T00:41:05Z,2,"Still haven't received them or the blanket and it's been well over a month. Was supposed to be a Christmas present.  Still waiting.   The""mock up"" they sent me looks like they chopped the pictures up even though i specifically said no edits needed in the creation section"
PupSocks,2020-12-27T00:39:53Z,5,Got a pair of socks for each of my daughters with photos of their pet as a stocking stuffer. They loved them! Highly recommend!
PupSocks,2020-12-27T00:33:03Z,1,"Have no idea in order has ever been shipped,  no email no tracking number what happened to it?"
PupSocks,2020-12-27T00:32:46Z,3,The material isn’t the best.  You could use softer material.  When putting the socks on they don’t wrap around your toes due to the type material and how they are sewn.
PupSocks,2020-12-27T00:30:47Z,2,"I am very disappointed with my order. One of the photos I used for my blanket had a cat & a dog in it. I specifically wrote in the notes when I placed my order that I wanted The dog to be included in the photo on the blanket. I then did the live chat & asked that employee what I needed to do insure it was done correctly. He advised that as long as I included my instructions in the notes, it would be correct. So, even though I spoke to an employee & included it in the notes, it was still wrong!"
PupSocks,2020-12-27T00:30:42Z,3,"These are really cute but the toes are squared instead of rounded which makes them not as comfortable to wear with shoes. Unfortunately, I’m not sure they were worth the price."
PupSocks,2020-12-27T00:27:38Z,5,The socks came out fantastic. They were a Christmas gift and the recipient wore them right away!
PupSocks,2020-12-27T00:22:00Z,5,We LOVED the blanket and socks we ordered for my daughter for Christmas. THe shipping was quick and the quality of the product was excellent.  Thanks!
PupSocks,2020-12-27T00:18:29Z,5,Everyone loved their Pupsocks!! They were a huge hit!
PupSocks,2020-12-27T00:11:23Z,1,"Thanks for sending us the review email. Sadly, CHRISTMAS has passed and we are still waiting for the masks which I ordered at the end of November."
PupSocks,2020-12-27T00:06:33Z,5,Pupper blanket was a huge Christmas hit with our daughter!  Wonderful.
PupSocks,2020-12-27T00:04:21Z,2,I ordered Black Friday and it is now the day after Christmas and I still don’t have them. So I wouldn’t rely on getting them when promised
PupSocks,2020-12-26T23:56:07Z,4,"I received my order before Christmas! Yeaaahhh: D but it was a bit long (I understand of course the circumstances), but I received well after a friend of mine who made their order after me).But I am very satisfied with the product and the quality! Thankkkkkksss i loooooove it ❤️By the way, I'm from Canada and when I made my order I was never made aware that the price was in USD or CAN ... I was a little surprised when I saw the invoice on my credit card oupsiiiiBut I’m still satisfied and happy 😃"
PupSocks,2020-12-26T23:53:34Z,5,Both the socks and the masks were a huge hit with my family.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T23:52:29Z,5,Great service product turned out great!!! It came quick and was perfect! I will be using again!
PupSocks,2020-12-26T23:51:36Z,2,"I ordered on November 28, 2020. I am still waiting for my products. A shipping sticker was generated on  December 12th, a package was not shipping until December 20, 2020. So the delays were caused by Pup Socks not by the US Post office. This is a long time to wait for a pair of socks that cost as much as they did. It’s disappointing."
PupSocks,2020-12-26T23:47:13Z,5,Love the blanket! It’s super soft and the pictures of the dogs turned out awesome! This was a great gift idea for my boyfriend’s mom who loves her dogs.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T23:46:42Z,5,I bought several pairs of pup socks for Christmas gifts and the recipients were so delighted with them. They were exactly as advertised. One pair contained a pic of my daughter's childhood pup who has crossed the rainbow bridge. I thought she was going to cry when she saw his face included with her two current puppers. The look on the girl's faces was well worth the price!
PupSocks,2020-12-26T23:45:41Z,5,Loved them! Quick delivery too.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T23:40:43Z,1,Before you send asking for a review maybe make sure the customer has received their product or  the refund you offered and then never processed once it was agreed that was what they wanted.  Absolutely a joke you send some email saying you did a mock up to give to people if they were a gift to show what’s coming mock up in original email is wrong and then you say if it’s a mask there will be a separate email sent with the mock up and that was never received.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T23:34:04Z,1,"Haven't heard from the company yet,  despite having ordered several weeks ago. No shipping notice, etc. Then they sent me this email about a review. Considering that this is the only communication I've received from them, the one star is generous."
PupSocks,2020-12-26T23:32:35Z,5,"Our big boy crossed the rainbow 🌈 bridge this and my littles were devistated. I’m so thankful for these blankets. My children can snuggle them whenever they miss their boy. They are soft, the image is visible and not blurry, andThe cropping was perfect"
PupSocks,2020-12-26T23:23:42Z,5,Looks great! Thanks!
PupSocks,2020-12-26T23:20:31Z,1,I ordered a blanket with a picture of my daughters cat printed on it. I got a blanket with two dogs on it.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T23:19:47Z,1,"Received the wrong order. I don’t know whose item this is, but it’s not what I ordered. Received after a month-long wait no less."
PupSocks,2020-12-26T23:16:45Z,1,Never received the product
PupSocks,2020-12-26T23:16:44Z,1,I gave one star cause first of all didn’t get my order in and still waiting on it and still didn’t get news for you and see where they are and each pair of socks have design and they send me the idea of image on them and some of them aren’t right
PupSocks,2020-12-26T23:11:41Z,5,My girlfriend loved her socks it turned into the best Christmas present ever!! Highly recommend for yourself or someone close to you!
PupSocks,2020-12-26T23:11:40Z,5,The perfect stocking stuffer this Christmas!
PupSocks,2020-12-26T23:10:31Z,5,Look fantastic !  A little too snug but overall amazing !  Gonna get a blanket next.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T23:08:13Z,1,I ordered late november and my socks still haven’t arrived... They we’re a XMas gift. Very disappointed!
PupSocks,2020-12-26T23:02:14Z,5,"Cute!  Happy with the quality.  At first look upon receiving, I thought the socks looked huge.  But, no the small was a perfect fit for a 10 year old."
PupSocks,2020-12-26T22:51:42Z,1,Still waiting been over a month
PupSocks,2020-12-26T22:45:26Z,1,Ordered it a few weeks before Christmas and didn’t get it and it’s now after Christmas.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T22:43:17Z,1,"Exceptionally long time in production. Knowing Christmas is around the corner orders should’ve left a lot quicker. Logistics need to be better coordinated and someone needs to find a quicker method from order time to boxing the orders. Shipping there is always delays, but you need to get it out the door quicker into the shippers hands. 1 1/2 months is way too long. My order spent almost 30 days in production, and I still don’t have it yet."
PupSocks,2020-12-26T22:40:25Z,5,Awesome awesome awesome. Little hiccup with the timeline for delivery but it’s always super busy around the holidays and they arrived on time and where awesome. For sure going to order more stuff.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T22:35:11Z,5,The socks are really cute. It did take a month to get them but my daughter loved them
PupSocks,2020-12-26T22:30:04Z,5,Really impressed with the quality of the photo on the socks! They look amazing and clear. The socks are good quality fabric. It was much loved as a gift to someone who loooves their dog!
PupSocks,2020-12-26T22:24:44Z,1,"I usually don't do reviews but I wasn't happy with my experience so I wanted to share. I can't comment on quality of the product but on the service. The Facebook ads say 1 day shipping but it took 2 weeks to get it. Once I got my package I flipped when the order was all wrong. Taking 2 weeks to get my order I had little faith in seeing my corrected order in time for Christmas. I emailed Pupsocks saying I wasn't happy on how long it took to get my package and how the order was all wrong and I wanted my money back. The auto response said they would reply within 72 hours. Now I know I won't get my corrected order in time for Christmas. A week later... Pupsocks replies saying that per tracking, I received my order and thank you.  I ordered pink socks with my 3 dogs face's and I got blue socks with someone's cat. Order was wrong and because  Christmas was around the corner and they screwed it up, I wanted a refund. I emailed them back all this and never heard back. I'm sure someone is complaining that they didn't get their cat socks and pissed like me. Customer Service sucks and I would give less than 1 if I could. I hope this review helps someone decide to go somewhere else when reading my review."
PupSocks,2020-12-26T22:19:57Z,1,Ear loops were extremely big and uneven on each side. Mask does not stay up on face. That was disappointing.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T22:18:41Z,1,My order arrived after Christmas and it had someone else’s pet on them.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T22:13:33Z,1,"Did not get socks in time for Christmas even though I ordered them in November.  Then I asked to cancel order when it became clear they wouldn't arrive in time,  the refunded me a store credit.  I don't want a store credit,  I just want my money back."
PupSocks,2020-12-26T22:04:20Z,1,THEY SENT ME THE WRONG DOG AND HAVE YET TO ISSUE A REFUND OR RESPOND TO ME 2 WEEKS LATER!! This is a scam!!
PupSocks,2020-12-26T21:59:21Z,5,"Socks are wonderful. Shipping time was not. Ordered 11/27/20 and didn’t receive until 12/26/20. I do understand this has been a very rough year, that’s why I gave you 5 stars. The product is excellent."
PupSocks,2020-12-26T21:58:21Z,1,"I ordered these socks on Black Friday and I still have not received these socks and it’s dec 26! After Christmas!!! They advertise being able to receive the item in 8-15 days after the order was made and it was been twice that.  I reached out 2 weeks ago to make sure that my order would arrive before Christmas and they assured me it would. This company has no idea how to manage orders or time definitely around the holidays. Do not order socks from here if you want them by a particular date. If you do give it a 2 mount cushion, because obviously 1 month wasn’t enough!"
PupSocks,2020-12-26T21:57:01Z,4,"The socks are really cute. Quality seems fine too. Regular price seem a bit high. However, I received a coupon for my next order which I used on a blanket."
PupSocks,2020-12-26T21:51:49Z,4,"The products look great... love them... only thing I wish is that when I was designing it something would have popped up to tell me that I was putting cat faces on a blanket meant for dogs- it has DOG BONES ALL OVER IT! A confirmation email or phone call would have been nice. Something to let me know I was doing it wrong. The blanket is great quality, and soft and the socks are nice- but dog bones all over with cat faces- bugs me every time I look at that Gi͏f͏t I gave my mom! Not cool"
PupSocks,2020-12-26T21:51:20Z,5,The grandchildren love having a picture of their dog on the socks.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T21:49:36Z,5,I ordered socks for my daughter’s boyfriend with a picture of their puppy. They were the most amazing gift and I couldn’t have been happier. The receiver also loved the socks.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T21:49:08Z,1,"It’s has been almost 2 months and I have not received my item, I have written many times to customer service and no replies, wouldn’t recommend at all."
PupSocks,2020-12-26T21:38:22Z,5,"Socks turned out awesome. Had some made for my Dad. He loves them, whoever did the editing did a great job, Dad’s dog is a wire hair griffon, I’d imagine it was a challenge to get the image right given how scruffy and long their hair is on their faces. Very happy customer!"
PupSocks,2020-12-26T21:31:39Z,1,"I ordered a sock and blanket set in November. I received the order December 26th. And the order is wrong. The set was supposed to have four dogs on it with one as the ""featured face"". Instead I get a set with JUST the featured face.  Customer service has not helped at all."
PupSocks,2020-12-26T21:29:12Z,1,I didn't receive one pair.  And I also received a pair with some random dog that wasn't a dog that I  know.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T21:27:39Z,5,I ordered 5 pairs of socks for our family. Each pair turned out great!!! We love them.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T21:24:53Z,2,"Socks and mask were cute, but IMO, the product is really expensive for such poor quality materials.  Sorry.  I really wanted to love this purchase.  Instead, I feel a little taken advantage of."
PupSocks,2020-12-26T21:17:43Z,5,I ordered these PupSocks for my kids for Christmas and they didn't disappoint!  It was by far the favorite gift of the year.  Now they can have a little bit of our two fur babies with them where ever they go!
PupSocks,2020-12-26T21:14:58Z,5,Bought a pair of the holiday socks for my son and now everyone wants a pair!
PupSocks,2020-12-26T21:11:27Z,5,Adorable! Beloved by all family members. Perfect Christmas gifts.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T21:11:18Z,5,Great gift! Order was delivered quickly too!
PupSocks,2020-12-26T21:10:17Z,5,Nice socks and graphic.  Made a big hit
PupSocks,2020-12-26T21:09:26Z,5,I ordered two pairs of socks as Christmas gifts. My brother and his girlfriend loved them! The socks are a thick quality. The pictures of. It’s the dog and two cats was printed clearly and washed well!
PupSocks,2020-12-26T21:00:57Z,5,These were a great gift for our neighbors. The dog design was perfect. Thank you.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T20:58:08Z,5,These socks came out purrfectly. The look on my husband's face when he realized that his favorite cat was on the socks was priceless.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T20:50:39Z,5,Nice quality sock.  The picture I chose looks great.  They were a Christmas gift that I’d ordered a tiny bit late.  They made it with a day to spare!  Pupsocks sent a mock up email to share with the gift recipient just in case.  Great service!
PupSocks,2020-12-26T20:42:13Z,1,Did not receive my order. No response on any inquiry.  Their chat was not working either.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T20:35:52Z,5,Great product
PupSocks,2020-12-26T20:32:25Z,1,I was suppose to receive my socks and this was the 2nd mistake you guys made. There was nothing in my package. It was empty!
PupSocks,2020-12-26T20:27:21Z,3,"Finished product is great and totally true to the order, so on the whole I’m satisfied and would recommend. Even though the process to get it was kind of weird, I mean, come on, it’s the holidays in a year where we’re ordering more and more delivered products than ever. Give them a break!  Automated email communication moderated my expectations pretty well.  A packaged arrived a day or after it was forecasted to arrive (but again, hey, holidays, no big deal).  But the blanket that arrived featured some one else’s pet!  That gave us a good laugh, but wasn’t the gift we ordered for a family member.  It turned into a good laugh at our gift exchange, and we promised to get her the right blanket w her cat on it once we get it all sorted out.  The next morning a blanket w the right cat on it showed up at our door.  Funny, weird, a little inconvenient but hey.  Happy it worked out well, and I guess we get a double blanket out of it?  Idk, maybe it was a promo.  Anyway, fine product, thanks y’all."
PupSocks,2020-12-26T20:22:03Z,2,The picture was exactly as I wanted. The actual sock is oddly shaped. The foot area is super big and loose and the top part is super tight.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T20:15:33Z,4,The only downside was how long it took to receive the package! The product was amazing and everything else was great. I understand it was holiday season but it took almost a month from date of order until the date I received the items!
PupSocks,2020-12-26T20:13:55Z,1,"I never received the order.  I ordered these socks Nov 28/2020, plenty of time for Christmas.  Still nothing.  It’s hard to review something when I never received anything and paid for them 1 month ago.  Very frustrating."
PupSocks,2020-12-26T20:03:26Z,1,"I ordered one pair of socks on Thanksgiving. As of 12/26, I still have not received the socks. The time to produce the product and then ship it is extensive and I would not order again."
PupSocks,2020-12-26T20:01:36Z,3,"Very cute socks and image quality was great. However, the material is like like a stocking and it didn’t fit well. Was hoping for more of a men’s dress sock."
PupSocks,2020-12-26T20:00:45Z,5,"The quality was very impressive! I got these as a gag gift for my partner, but the material is very nice and the printing was superb. They are hilarious and she will no doubt love them. One tip, the quality of your socks depends on the picture you select, so it's worth getting a gag-worthy photo before ordering, as opposed to just picking one you have on hand. I had my dog sit and look up at the camera, and the effect was great."
PupSocks,2020-12-26T19:56:26Z,5,My granddaughters loved their socks. In fact one cried when she got them. They were a big hit!!
PupSocks,2020-12-26T19:54:28Z,5,We love our pupsocks!
PupSocks,2020-12-26T19:52:09Z,3,"I ordered a man size and young child size.  However,  the young child size was an adult size.  They were gifted to my son in law and 4 yr old granddaughter.  My daughter will probably end up wearing because the socks were way to big for my granddaughter."
PupSocks,2020-12-26T19:50:21Z,1,"The design is cute, but I don’t think this company understands how socks work. The material is awful and is not shaped to fit a foot. These things are flat and don’t account for the heal needing more fabric. As a result the fabric bunches up on the front of your ankle. Unless you walk around on your tip toes and your toes are all the same length, don’t buy these!"
PupSocks,2020-12-26T19:44:09Z,5,Ordered socks for family and friends during the holidays and it couldn’t have been easier. From hitting the order button to receiving the socks I got email notifications for everything! The socks arrived in time for the big day and they are SO perfect. Couldn’t be happier.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T19:41:52Z,5,Look great - just as expected.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T19:38:36Z,5,"Not only do the socks look awesome, but the quality is top-notch!!!!"
PupSocks,2020-12-26T19:34:13Z,1,It’s been over a month since I’ve ordered my product and I still haven’t received it.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T19:34:12Z,5,"I purchased a blanket from PupSocks with our two dogs on it, my daughter said it was the best Christmas gift ever!"
PupSocks,2020-12-26T19:31:45Z,5,I bought these for my husband for Christmas.He loved them!
PupSocks,2020-12-26T19:29:06Z,1,Extremely slow shipping to Canada. I placed an order a month ago and it still hasn't arrived.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T19:27:33Z,5,"Great product, worth the money!! It made an awesome gift. Thank you!"
PupSocks,2020-12-26T19:21:43Z,4,"The print is a good likeness, roomy in the foot area but snug enough in the calf area to stay up. My daughters are very happy with them."
PupSocks,2020-12-26T19:18:44Z,2,"Cute idea and the pictures came out well on the socks, but truly just horrible quality of fabric. It felt weirdly like nylon and were just not soft or comfortable."
PupSocks,2020-12-26T19:15:04Z,5,"I got my order about a week before Christmas. It was a mask, that had a defect. It was to be a gift, so I hurried up and emailed about it. Got an automated response about how busy they were. To my absolute amazement, I received a corrected one before Christmas! I was totally shocked that they got it out that quickly, and of course was ecstatic about it!"
PupSocks,2020-12-26T19:13:42Z,5,Awesome job!!
PupSocks,2020-12-26T19:11:21Z,1,Ordered well over a month and still could not be here for Christmas never said anything about any kind of delay until after I placed my order
PupSocks,2020-12-26T19:10:30Z,3,"I placed my order on Nov 28th for a Christmas gift. I did receive the item on Dec 24th, but had no way to communicate with customer service for shipping updates (no phone number and 2 email inquiries were not responded to). The product was good quality but customer service and product fulfillment time needs to be improved upon."
PupSocks,2020-12-26T18:56:29Z,5,Super rad and creates lots of laughs💕✌️
PupSocks,2020-12-26T18:56:29Z,3,Ordered two pairs of socks and wanted two dog faces on each pair. Received two pairs of socks with a different dog on each pair. Although the dogs were recognizing it wasn’t what I wanted.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T18:54:58Z,5,The socks look just like our favorite boy! Great gift!!
PupSocks,2020-12-26T18:53:15Z,4,The printing on the socks was absolutely perfect! The quality of the actual socks used is not very good though.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T18:52:57Z,5,Love the product and the customer service.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T18:50:41Z,3,"The socks are adorable but they are purely decorative. The socks themselves are very poor quality so they aren't wearable. So if you want to get a gift just as a gesture or for decoration, they are delightful, but don't expect to use or have them function as actual socks."
PupSocks,2020-12-26T18:42:10Z,4,socks looked great when they arrivedThe pictures were same as the photos i sent and i enjoyed the cute socks
PupSocks,2020-12-26T18:41:44Z,5,Love love love them. They came out perfect.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T18:40:56Z,5,The blanket is awesome- love that I could get something like this with my baby girls face plastered all over it. She also enjoys laying on it.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T18:35:07Z,1,"A waste of money.  Purchased 4 pair for Christmas gifts.  The picture on the socks looks great but when the family tried to put on the socks, there was no elasticity in one half of the sock.  It was like the fibers were all stiff and stuck together. If pulled it creates a permanent separation in the fibers.  VERY poor quality and too much trouble to pay to send back."
PupSocks,2020-12-26T18:34:25Z,5,These socks were a hit on Christmas morning. My family loved them. I’d highly recommend them for anyone crazy about their pets.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T18:32:57Z,5,The socks and blanket I bought are both good. Good.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T18:31:33Z,1,I am so disappointed! This was a very special gift for a very special person. I placed an order for a blanket with my friends dogs pictures on it. When I finally received my order... just a week before Christmas... it was the wrong order! I received someone else’s blanket!!!wrong dog... wrong order!!! I’ve emailed the company four times and have waited over a week for a response and still no response!!! Now Christmas is over and I have no blanket! This was an expensive gift ... and now I’m out the money and the gift. I know this company has experienced a high volume of emails.... but it’s been over a week and no response!  There’s no phone number to call and no other way to reach this company ! I’m soupset and disappointed!Maria Humphrey
PupSocks,2020-12-26T18:30:45Z,5,Absolutely adorable and the best gift ever!!!
PupSocks,2020-12-26T18:27:02Z,5,Picture came out great. Fast service too.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T18:25:25Z,5,The socks are the cutest and shipping was fast too!
PupSocks,2020-12-26T18:16:47Z,1,I can’t provide a positive review for something that I never received despite my multiple emails to the company. I haven’t received a refund either.  Really disappointed.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T18:15:07Z,5,Great blanket with great quality! 5⭐️🌟⭐️🌟⭐️
PupSocks,2020-12-26T18:13:03Z,5,Best gift ever!!!Had these made for my adult kids and they loved them! A great way to have long distance kids enjoy home by having their pups in their socks!
PupSocks,2020-12-26T18:10:46Z,1,I was sent the wrong socks so not only did I get the wrong socks. But someone else didn’t get the socks they ordered either. No 1800 number easily accessed
PupSocks,2020-12-26T18:08:09Z,5,My blanket could not have turned out any better! The quality of my pup’s image is amazing and the blanket itself is super soft! My daughter absolutely LOVES her new keepsake!
PupSocks,2020-12-26T18:06:55Z,2,"The socks are cute and colorful.  Unfortunately the fit is way off. They are baggy in the toes, tight in the ankles, heel doesn’t fit properly.  Not true to size."
PupSocks,2020-12-26T18:05:43Z,2,"The customer service is atrocious. Too many delays. I ordered my product Nov 16th and did receive until Dec 23, 1 month later. It took them two weeks to response to my emails to let me know it was delayed and never produced. Although the socks and masks are soft, the socks are very narrow  fitting tightly an the masks are rather small, without any pouch for a filter. VERY DISAPPOINTED."
PupSocks,2020-12-26T18:03:12Z,1,Never received the socks.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T18:01:27Z,5,"Absolutely the best and quickest service we have ever received on an internet based custom order.  The socks are great, and the imagery execution is flawless.   Wish the socks were slightly bigger, as they barely work on my feet.  Either way, these are a great gift for anyone with a pet.  Love these socks......"
PupSocks,2020-12-26T18:01:24Z,2,"I placed my order nov 30th, received an email dec 3rd with shipping information through USPS. The order never got delivered and the shipping never updated. I got another email stating my order would have to be replaced on December 13th. I email customer service 2 times, no response.  I finally get an email on December 22nd saying it shipped. Today is December 26th, still no updated. I understand the delays with USPS but I paid for shipping and ordered my gift very early. I am beyond frustrated. I will be using another customized service in the future because the communication has been poor."
PupSocks,2020-12-26T18:00:46Z,2,"I can’t rate my product as I don’t have it.  The US postal service is the worst choice you could make.  Find another way, give options especially for international orders.  This is the second year I have delayed delivery and missed Christmas."
PupSocks,2020-12-26T17:59:53Z,3,"They’re cute, but the toes are totally square- the corners stick out past my big and little toes. They’re quite uncomfortable in shoes because of the extra material in the corners."
PupSocks,2020-12-26T17:58:02Z,1,Extremely delayed and bad customer service
PupSocks,2020-12-26T17:57:05Z,2,The image was great but the socks were poor quality and didn't fit right. Another present that will end up in the back of the drawer.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T17:56:00Z,5,Very nice mask. Pics came out great. Would definitely use them again!
PupSocks,2020-12-26T17:54:55Z,1,Terrible service. Still haven’t received my Christmas order that I placed in November. I have tried to reach out a few times and keep getting the old “covid 19” excuse. Looking to cancel my order right after this review. Frustrating...
PupSocks,2020-12-26T17:51:37Z,5,Amazing!!!!
PupSocks,2020-12-26T17:51:25Z,1,"I placed an order in November and still have not received it. I ordered from here because the turn around said I would have my order in 12-15 days. I reached out to customer service on December 20th, received a generic email from the “CEO” blaming the USPS and Covid, and still have not received my order. I haven’t even received a tracking number and only just received a “mock-up” of the blanket to show my brother for Christmas morning, which indicates to me that the blanket hasn’t even been made yet nor shipped yet. I am extremely disappointed and will never be ordering again, or recommending this company to anyone."
PupSocks,2020-12-26T17:50:30Z,5,The socks were AMAZING! I will be getting everyone I know a set for every occasion until they tell me to stop. You have created a monster Pupsocks!
PupSocks,2020-12-26T17:50:11Z,2,I ordered 2 pairs of socks and a mask on Black Friday. Friday November 27th. I understand that it takes awhile to make and to ship but I got no updates. I ordered them as Christmas presents and they still haven’t come.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T17:43:32Z,5,"The socks I ordered for my grandson turned out so cute! Beautiful blue color and, big bonus, came in a size that fits his men's size 14 feet. Of course,  the adorable dog face made the socks a huge hit. Perfect gift!"
PupSocks,2020-12-26T17:43:10Z,1,"Very upset with this company. I made two separate orders in the same day. Both contained a customs mask and socks. My first order hasn’t even shipped yet, but I ordered it way back in November and was told I would receive it for Christmas. My second order came but there were NUMEROUS issues. First, the packing was ripped to shreds, there was dirt all over the socks and even ripped up cloth. The mask had a sliver of white fabric that wasn’t cut and then there is a second line of stitching that starts on the time and stops half way. It looks incredibly cheap and I am worried my second set will look just the same. I either want better quality versions or my money back. This was the MOST upsetting and disappointing Christmas gift. I have also contacted the company so many times, yet NO one has cared to reach out to tel me where my one order is and to remedy the issues with my damaged package. I would like to speak to someone."
PupSocks,2020-12-26T17:36:34Z,5,"Very very cool....my teenage daughter loves them! It was so funny when sh opened them of course she said ""awwwww"" amd then almost immediately, "" is that Ele""?????Recommend highly...good quality and just such a cool idea!!"
PupSocks,2020-12-26T17:34:46Z,5,The blanket and socks turned out amazing!! My family members loved them!!
PupSocks,2020-12-26T17:34:38Z,1,"I really wanted to love these socks but the sizing is horrible and the material is not good! I've tried to reach out about getting a refund and no one has gotten back to me yet I've gotten TONS of emails about buying more items, a mock up of my socks because ""I wouldn't recieve them by Christmas"" (but I already have them?), and this email about leaving a review. I understand times are hard, I won't complain about the shipping time, but please consider making some improvements."
PupSocks,2020-12-26T17:33:49Z,5,Such a fun gift to give!!!
PupSocks,2020-12-26T17:31:04Z,5,My wife was extremely happy with the pink socks with her fur baby on them!
PupSocks,2020-12-26T17:28:55Z,1,I would not order through them again. I ordered two pairs of socks on November 28 for Christmas presents for my daughters. Still haven’t received them. Emailed three times and it was the same automatic reply. Find a better site to order!!
PupSocks,2020-12-26T17:28:02Z,1,ordered in early December and not yet delivered
PupSocks,2020-12-26T17:27:46Z,5,Great quality material and printing. They were a Christmas favorite!!
PupSocks,2020-12-26T17:27:03Z,1,"I still have not received the order which was ordered on November 30th,2020 as christmas gifts.Not happy"
PupSocks,2020-12-26T17:26:11Z,4,Image quality was good. Material is a little weird. It’s questionable quality/durability. Immediately had a thread seem develop after opening.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T17:23:54Z,4,"These were purchased as a gift on November 28 and although I worried for nearly a month that they wouldn’t arrive in time, by a miracle they were delivered on Christmas Eve. The gift recipient loved them so everyone is happy."
PupSocks,2020-12-26T17:23:41Z,1,I still haven’t received the socks. Just disappointed in how tardy my order is.  Missed a present for someone this year and I ordered quite a while ago with promises of delivery that kept changing. I would have got something else. They did provide 25 % off order but I still don’t have the socks
PupSocks,2020-12-26T17:23:01Z,1,Order received is not what I ordered. No invoice or  contact info.  Did find an email address - took a few days for a response but still no resolution and they were supposed to have been a Christmas present
PupSocks,2020-12-26T17:22:58Z,3,I was a little disappointed - I sent a high quality pic but the image of my dog was a little dark and part of his ear was cut off on the socks-
PupSocks,2020-12-26T17:20:14Z,4,"Cute socks!  My son loved them, but they run very small."
PupSocks,2020-12-26T17:19:18Z,3,"The service is very quick and the pictures on the socks were very nice. However, the socks are made out of the weirdest material and they do not stretch.  My son could not get them past his ankle, so he just put them on display."
PupSocks,2020-12-26T17:15:20Z,5,"Even though shipping was very hectic, they made an effort to provide something for the gift giver to give to their recipient"
PupSocks,2020-12-26T17:14:31Z,5,"The socks were perfect, the picture of my son’s dog was exactly like the picture I uploaded. Very happy with my purchase!"
PupSocks,2020-12-26T17:13:50Z,1,Haven’t received my product. No response from customer service. Not entirely sure if they actually exist? I have heard the same from other people who have tried to order from pupsocks. Waste of time and money.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T17:12:43Z,5,All my items were great.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T17:10:53Z,5,"I got a pair of pup socks for a friend for Christmas.  She loved them so much that she ordered another pair, a mask, and a pair for her husband."
PupSocks,2020-12-26T17:09:52Z,5,Blanket & Socks look Amazing
PupSocks,2020-12-26T17:02:43Z,2,I ordered two pairs of socks as a Christmas gift on 11/27...it's now 12/26 and they still aren't here.  Can't review the quality of the product if I don't have it.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T17:02:11Z,1,Never received items
PupSocks,2020-12-26T17:00:50Z,1,Ordered 1 pair of socks-6 weeks ago. Not yet received
PupSocks,2020-12-26T17:00:36Z,1,Twice they sent me someone else’s socks!  I’m still waiting for a refund from this.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T17:00:22Z,1,"I still have not received my order from November.  Was guaranteed 8-10 business days.  I have sent numerous unanswered emails.  However, they did take my money. I cannot actually review a product I have not received (was to be a Christmas gift for my kids).  I can review the service though.  100% POOR!."
PupSocks,2020-12-26T17:00:08Z,5,My son loved the socks with his puppy face on them!   Great birthday gift!!
PupSocks,2020-12-26T16:59:34Z,1,"Worst customer service, haven’t received my order yet, ruined Christmas presents. No responds and it’s all lies."
PupSocks,2020-12-26T16:59:31Z,5,Super fast shipping and great customer service!  Socks are great!  Super high quality pictures on socks that are no doubt our dog.  My girlfriend was so excited when she open her socks for Christmas!  The material is a little different than any sock I have seen or used before but I think it will also last much longer than other socks so I am more than ok with that!
PupSocks,2020-12-26T16:59:29Z,5,Excellent quality sock and they did a great job with our cats face.  Our family loves them.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T16:58:58Z,5,I gifted 2 styles of socks and they were a hit!  They printed exactly as the photo and were excellent quality.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T16:58:15Z,5,Loved the socks!
PupSocks,2020-12-26T16:56:20Z,1,"I never received my order of 4 pairs of socks.  It was ordered in November, shipped December 1.  Unable to rate the product itself.  Probably not the fault of Pupsocks, but the postal service.  Nevertheless, $90 order still missing."
PupSocks,2020-12-26T16:54:51Z,4,Very nice product overall. Wish they would have used a little thicker material.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T16:54:24Z,5,"I got my sister a pair with her dog’s face on them for Christmas and they were a hit! The picture turned out awesome, and I want to buy a pair for every pet owner I know now. I appreciated the periodic emails I would get updating me on when the order was received, when production started, and when they were ready to be shipped out. It took a couple weeks to receive them, but that is to be expected for an independent business in December.Overall, very happy and would definitely purchase from them again!"
PupSocks,2020-12-26T16:52:28Z,3,"I got the blanket and socks combo...While the blanket is adorable I must say the socks were really a disappointment I never touched a material quite like that...gross, I would never put those on my feet.So, 3 stars...Delivery was good"
PupSocks,2020-12-26T16:51:02Z,1,I received someone else’s order and have gotten no reply to my attempts to contact you. It is unheard of for a company to not have a contract phone number for customer service. Only response to my message was a can message apologizing about being overwhelmed with messages because of delayed shipments. I have since read on Facebook that receiving incorrect orders is common from your company. I don’t see how you are still in business!
PupSocks,2020-12-26T16:50:05Z,5,"I got three different pup socks for my friends for Christmas. They all loved them. Quality is great, and the pics were clear. An excellent product."
PupSocks,2020-12-26T16:46:52Z,2,Ordered my socks end of November. Have been in Miami since Dec 10th. As of December 26.. still in Miami.. So much for my Christmas gift...Regardless of Covid.. not very close to delivery time mentioned when I ordered them.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T16:43:25Z,5,I love the socks!! The pictures we sent in of our two dogs were cropped perfectly and are very clear. The package arrived on time. The socks are good quality. I gave them to my teenage daughter as a gift and she was delighted.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T16:42:48Z,5,"Super cute, fun gift! Would definitely recommend."
PupSocks,2020-12-26T16:42:28Z,4,"They look great!  My only bummer was that they didn't put all the faces on the socks that were in the picture.  Not a big deal, but surprising.  Still a loved present by the family!"
PupSocks,2020-12-26T16:42:03Z,5,I bought a pair of socks for my son for Christmas with a pic of his cat.  The socks were a hit and his favorite gift.  The picture is exactly what I sent and the socks seem to be a good quality sock.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T16:41:20Z,4,Very cute and they made a fun gift for my kids. My daughter did say they fit a little oddly but overall were very comfortable.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T16:39:24Z,5,Received on time for Christmas and the Socks were everything I was hoping for.  The recipients love them.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T16:39:19Z,4,The socks are adorable! The photos are clear and sharp. The socks themselves are rather thin and I doubt if they will hold up well. But a fun gift nevertheless.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T16:37:37Z,2,"Although I selected white socks, the photo of my dog is so dark it is hard to see.  The pictures on the socks do not look like the photo I sent in at all.  It's like they ""shaved"" my dog to put his picture on the socks.  This is such a cute idea, but I am very disappointed in the product!  This was an expensive lesson, paying over $60 for two low quality pairs of socks (socks alone are very cheap) with pictures that don't look like my dog."
PupSocks,2020-12-26T16:37:24Z,5,Pups socks are an excellent gift for the dog lover in your life!
PupSocks,2020-12-26T16:35:57Z,5,I ordered a blanket with my daughter's favorite dog and it turned out to be the best present under the tree! The blanket is actually soft and comfy too! I will be ordering again!
PupSocks,2020-12-26T16:34:40Z,2,Only half of items arrived before Christmas.   Quality of picture looked cheap!  Not happy at all.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T16:33:14Z,5,Could not have asked for more!! They turned out perfectly and both kids loved seeing their dogs on the socks. Thank you!!
PupSocks,2020-12-26T16:33:03Z,1,Ordered these a month ago and have not received. They are meant to be delivered today. The day after Christmas.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T16:32:52Z,5,I had a great experience with PupSocks.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T16:30:49Z,1,"I ordered socks as a Christmas present on November 28th and I still don’t have them. I know because if Covid there are delays but when I checked on your website to contact you about them, I read that if you’d ordered them between a certain date in December and paid extra, you’d get them before Christmas???? I ordered mine almost a month before because of Covid and made sure from what your website says that they’d be here before Christmas or I wouldn’t have gone ahead and bought them. There was no gift for my brother to open on Christmas morning. I am beyond upset, I’ll never order from you again. When I sent an email asking where they are, you sent me some generic email that I can forward to my brother to prove they’re on the way??? So ridiculous, they should be here. I’m very upset on how this turned out."
PupSocks,2020-12-26T16:29:50Z,5,"Love the socks,  they are great.   Great quality and fast shipping"
PupSocks,2020-12-26T16:29:29Z,3,One set was perfect with the croping of the image and used my directions perfect. The other did not crop in the box and just the face. This made for the same face twice.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T16:29:20Z,1,Ordered socks and a blanket a month ago and am unable to get a status from the company- 3 separate emails with no response. Order has been in production for a month. It's just bad business to blow off your customers.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T16:28:53Z,2,"I only give these socks 2 stars because the pictures came out well on the socks. Buy sadly, the socks themselves are extremely poor quality. They are uncomfortable material, super stiff and are horrendous tube socks that have no shape to them. This makes the whole sock so uncomfortable that they are unwearable. So sadly, I have cute pictures of my animals on these socks that I will never be able to wear."
PupSocks,2020-12-26T16:26:26Z,5,The socks are great. My husband was delighted with them and recognized our black lab immediately!
PupSocks,2020-12-26T16:26:12Z,1,Was so excited to get these products until they arrived and the quality is very bad the socks do not fit right and feels like rubber bands around your ankle when you try to put these on. The masks were huge and did not fit well . Terrible quality for the almost 50 dollars I paid. Total waste of my money.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T16:26:05Z,2,"Ordering was very easy.  However, upon receiving my order I was missing a pair(I ordered 2 pair) of socks.  I did receive someone else's order in my order which means someone other than me did not receive the correct order.   The only way of contact is through email and my problem was not solved prior to Christmas.  Needless to say I am disappointed and my order issue is still not solved nor have I been contacted by PupSocks to remedy this problem."
PupSocks,2020-12-26T16:24:37Z,3,Everything was delivered on time which was great. The only major issue I had was that one of the dogs head was cut out perfect but the other dogs head was not. There was a piece of the background still attached to that dogs head so they look like they have a huge white leg coming out of their head. So I guess next time I’d use a darker background on the picture to make a better contrast between the dog and the background. Other than that shipping and ordering was super easy and it’s a good company.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T16:24:20Z,5,Awesome socks! My daughter in law loved them.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T16:23:41Z,5,The custom photo was perfectly cropped and the socks looked great. Made for a great gift!
PupSocks,2020-12-26T16:23:11Z,1,"Not impressed. Placed an order November 29, 2020 for a Christmas gift. It’s now December 26 and I still don’t have it. So disappointed!"
PupSocks,2020-12-26T16:22:22Z,1,"Shop elsewhere! I ordered socks on 11/27 and they arrived (with stains on them) on 12/24! I emailed customer service and received little to no response. Eventually they stopped responding all together! The only thing worse than the socks is the customer service. Lots of other sites offer the same product, shop elsewhere!!!"
PupSocks,2020-12-26T16:21:49Z,5,My sister loved them!
PupSocks,2020-12-26T16:21:10Z,5,"The Pupsocks were a hit!! Great gift!!! They came in tine fir Christmas, and everyone loved them. Thank you!"
PupSocks,2020-12-26T16:20:40Z,1,"I ordered 3 pairs all before December 10th.  Only received 1 pair for Christmas.   Still missing 2 pair; emailed 5 times, less than responsive. I would like a refund for my 2 pairs.   The quality of the pair I did receive is surprising for the amount I paid.  They are like hospital gown material.  With shipping I paid $50!!!!   Absurd."
PupSocks,2020-12-26T16:20:25Z,5,I bought several pairs of socks. Some had 3 dogs. Some had one dog. Everyone loved them. They were so excited to see their fur babies on the socks. They haven’t worn them yet so I can’t speak to the comfort but the excitement when seeing them and realizing it was their own pup was worth every penny I paid. The order came really fast too.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T16:20:13Z,2,These socks are not well made. They are more like fabric tubes made for ducks’ feet. Wider at the toes. No place for a heel. The picture turned out well which is why I’m not giving them 0 stars
PupSocks,2020-12-26T16:20:03Z,1,"I didn’t like the quality of the socks. The pictures clearly show socks with heels, but I received tube socks. I will not buy again."
PupSocks,2020-12-26T16:18:17Z,1,"Well, order the socks over a month ago and still have not received them.  Overpriced, but I though for Christmas it would be a funny gift.  Now that Christmas is over, they are not really needed.  Still do not know where my order is.  No customer support.  I would recommend not using this company."
PupSocks,2020-12-26T16:15:33Z,5,These socks were a hit as a gift.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T16:15:11Z,1,"The socks are not what they appeared to be online. They are stiff stretchy fabric, not sick material. Picture was not clear of my dog. The sizing is also way off. Ordered the large for a size 8 and they would probably fit an 11-12. These were not cheap, so it’s disappointing."
PupSocks,2020-12-26T16:14:12Z,5,"Picture was accurate!  Looks great.  Socks are slightly thin but overall, very cool!"
PupSocks,2020-12-26T16:14:07Z,5,Socks turned out amazing. I love them!!
PupSocks,2020-12-26T16:13:52Z,4,Nice product. Our pets faces came out beautifully. Recommend.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T16:13:08Z,1,I bought and adult small and they are the worst fitting socks ever. It is like they are one giant tube and have no bend on the top of your ankle so they are all bunched up there. They are 2 inches too wide and terrible fabric. I gave one as a gift and I am embarrassed. I’m especially disappointed because it ended up being $60 for two pair of socks even with the special. I contacted them about getting a better pair or a refund and I only heard back that they are inundated with issues and I need to wait. Extremely disappointed.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T16:12:42Z,4,Receiver loved them but purchaser thought they were expensive.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T16:10:58Z,1,I placed an order on November 27th for 9 pairs of socks for Christmas gifts.  Today is December 26th.  I still have not received them!  Horrible customer service. No phone number to call for help. They created a shipping label 9 days ago but still have not shipped. If they create a label they can lie and say they’ve shipped your item so you can’t get a refund. Do not order from them!!!
PupSocks,2020-12-26T16:10:06Z,5,My family loved the socks...We have a new puppy in the family and he looks adorable on the socks.  We will definitely purchase more in the future.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T16:10:04Z,5,"The recipient loved them.  If I order again, will use separate pics for each pet.  Used a pic with three pets on it and didn't love the way they were cut out onto the socks.  But again, they were loved by the recipient who thought it was such a thoughtful gift.  Will order again."
PupSocks,2020-12-26T16:09:53Z,1,It's been 6 weeks and I still haven't received my order.  I also emailed and messaged on Facebook with no reply.  Awful service
PupSocks,2020-12-26T16:07:57Z,1,"Completely messed up my order on the socks I ordered as a Christmas gift the first week of December.  Took customer service over 4 days to reply to my email acknowledging they messed up my order.  They finally said they would send me the actual socks I ordered but wouldn’t rush shipping so the socks I ordered for my dad for Christmas the first week of December are still not here.  The pair of socks they did send me which was someone else’s order, are not soft or look comfortable at all!  I will never ever order from this site again!!!!!"
PupSocks,2020-12-26T16:07:09Z,5,This was a gift for my husband. We lost our kitty a couple months ago. The socks brought tears on Christmas morning. I only wish I could have ordered them in black.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T16:07:03Z,3,"The face masks aren’t a good shape, they don’t fit well on an adult face. Plus the ear adjustments don’t come fitted on the loops and they’re very difficult to put on."
PupSocks,2020-12-26T16:05:48Z,1,I received the wrong order two weeks past the expected arrival date and almost a month after I placed the order.  I ordered three pairs of orange socks with a picture of our black lab.  I received one pair of Christmas socks with another persons dog on them. I have sent three emails with no response.  There is no phone number to call.  Super disappointed and out $70!
PupSocks,2020-12-26T16:05:39Z,5,I purchased these socks for my son. I believe it was his favorite Christmas gift!  Thank you !
PupSocks,2020-12-26T16:05:32Z,1,I don’t know how my order is cause I haven’t received it. Ordered nov 28th.. and hasn’t made it yet. Super disappointed as it didn’t make it for Christmas now I have to tell my friends to please hold on their gift. I am hoping it is worth the wait.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T16:05:27Z,1,"Still waiting...ordered 11/28 and it is now 12/26. These were Christmas gifts. Reached out multiple times no response. Ordered in the past, was very happy, if we are paying for shipping maybe give the customer the ability to select fed ex, I could have gotten this in time for the holiday."
PupSocks,2020-12-26T16:05:24Z,5,Everyone got pup socks as a stocking stuffer this year!  They were a hit!  The pic of our sweet Mini Aussie’s face was great!
PupSocks,2020-12-26T16:05:09Z,4,The socks looked amazing. The editing of the photo I sent was excellent and well placed on the socks. The socks look as expected based on the advertisements. But they are a bit less comfortable than expected. I’m thinking they need washed a couple more times to soften up.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T16:04:59Z,5,Socks were a gift.  She loved them.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T16:04:34Z,5,"Ordered a pair of socks for my daughter with her dog’s picture, and one for my wife with our cat’s picture.  They did a great job editing the faces and the detail was very good.  Arrived as promised."
PupSocks,2020-12-26T16:03:43Z,4,"Pleased overall with the final product. I would have appreciated a preview of what the actual product will look like before finalizing my order. Also, up-to-date order status and tracking information could be improved."
PupSocks,2020-12-26T16:03:22Z,5,👍 all good. Thank you
PupSocks,2020-12-26T16:02:15Z,1,Product has not shown up! I ordered on Black Friday and missed a Christmas gift. I have submitted a complaint with PayPal
PupSocks,2020-12-26T16:02:03Z,2,"Hello,Socks are cute but I needed sizes to fit 4 children who are 5-9 years old. The sizing on your web site needs major improvement. I ordered what seemed to be sizes for kids and they are much too large.. cute socks but they can't wear them for anything but playing in the house. Certainly not with shoes."
PupSocks,2020-12-26T16:01:03Z,1,Ordered 15 days ago still not here
PupSocks,2020-12-26T16:00:02Z,1,"Ordered 30 days ago and order still has not been processed. Customer service deplorable and impossible to reach, they don’t answer messages. They offered me a 15% discount- the same discount offered to all new customers. Christmas gift ruined. DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY."
PupSocks,2020-12-26T15:59:05Z,5,Great Product!
PupSocks,2020-12-26T15:57:34Z,5,I bought these socks to give as a Christmas present to my husband’s aunt and she loved it so much! She was amazed. The quality of the print is perfect! They came out exactly as the picture I provided. Great gift idea for pet lovers!
PupSocks,2020-12-26T15:57:16Z,5,"The socks were a big hit at Christmas!  The whole process of ordering, uploading photos and delivery was easy and very efficient.  I will definitely use again and recommend to others."
PupSocks,2020-12-26T15:56:12Z,5,These were great!
PupSocks,2020-12-26T15:55:35Z,5,They loved their Christmas gift!
PupSocks,2020-12-26T15:54:59Z,1,Order never showed up. Finally got a response from customer service. They said they were sending the order again. Still have not received the order. This has been going on since November 18.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T15:54:17Z,1,"Ordered Nov. 29th, order did not arrive in time for Christmas. Still haven’t received order."
PupSocks,2020-12-26T15:53:41Z,4,"Really happy with end product, I just wish delivery didn’t take so long but it was Christmas 2020, after all."
PupSocks,2020-12-26T15:53:39Z,5,"The blanket was a huge success! Pictures were great, couldn’t have been better. Blanket was a nice thickness."
PupSocks,2020-12-26T15:51:53Z,5,Loved the socks we got my husband for Christmas! They have been his favorite gift. He was amazed at the quality of the socks and clarity of the picture.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T15:50:23Z,5,These socks were my daughter’s favorite Christmas gift. They were perfect!
PupSocks,2020-12-26T15:50:11Z,5,Loved the socks. They were quite a hit as a gift.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T15:50:01Z,5,My family loved these socks!
PupSocks,2020-12-26T15:49:07Z,4,In one of the pics they cut my dogs ears out of the pic. Other than that my daughter likes her present.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T15:49:07Z,1,"I never received my order, i paid for nothing. Very disappointed."
PupSocks,2020-12-26T15:49:01Z,1,Poor quality of socks.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T15:48:21Z,5,Funny idea. My wife loved her socks.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T15:47:59Z,5,Nicely done!  The gift recipients were thrilled with the product!
PupSocks,2020-12-26T15:47:55Z,1,Difficult to join them...and over on month now and still not received my order!
PupSocks,2020-12-26T15:47:55Z,1,Our order has still not arrived - ordered them in November for a Christmas gift and still not here yet!   Unacceptable
PupSocks,2020-12-26T15:46:50Z,2,Didn’t like the material and they were way too big
PupSocks,2020-12-26T15:46:34Z,1,The idea was nice but the quality of the “socks” was poor. Women’s size 4-8 must be for extra extra wide feet because they are huge. The “socks” look like 2 pieces of my neoprene water bottle koozie stitched together. They are not wearable and I’d like a refund (it says to contact them but I’ve not heard back).
PupSocks,2020-12-26T15:42:36Z,5,We love our socks and blanket- nice job!
PupSocks,2020-12-26T15:41:03Z,5,The socks arrived on time for Christmas-thank you! The quality of socks and image matched the mock-up provided. I would definitely use this company again.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T15:37:57Z,5,The pictures I sent and the final product were spot on.  I did make a size error ordering but that was my mistake.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T15:36:24Z,4,I placed four orders in early December.  Only two arrived in time for Christmas.  You should not use the USPS for delivery.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T15:34:58Z,5,Very fun gift to memorialize a dear pet.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T15:34:57Z,5,The photos on the socks were awesome!!
PupSocks,2020-12-26T15:34:26Z,1,"I ordered a child's size sock with my daughter's cat, the socks were weird and adult size and the picture was absolutely terrible. You couldn't make out any features on the face. After I asked for item to be reprinted they never answered me back. They refunded me minus some fee, 2 weeks later I received someone else's blanket order with their dogs printed on it. Very terrible product and poor customer service."
PupSocks,2020-12-26T15:33:18Z,5,"I’ve given pup socks as gifts last year and this year for Christmas.  The pet owners love them! They are whimsical, fun, and put a smile on their faces. A fun gift to give."
PupSocks,2020-12-26T15:31:11Z,5,Was a gift and he loved it
PupSocks,2020-12-26T15:29:54Z,5,My daughter absolutely loved the blanket! Our cat passed away a couple months before and this just made her so happy!  The blanket is very soft.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T15:29:50Z,1,"The fit and quality of these socks was very disappointing.  They arrived quickly and the pictures were great but these socks will never be worn.  Very disappointed and wish I wouldn’t have bought two pair.  Waste of money and I was embarrassed to gift these.Update:As of 1.21.21 I never received the refund or email from pup socks per their reply ([Order #2433618] (November 27, 2020)"
PupSocks,2020-12-26T15:29:37Z,5,The team did a great job with the socks and they were a Christmas Day “hit”.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T15:29:33Z,1,"I placed an order a month ago and have had no update since then on the status. Contacted support twice to be told it is ""in production"". Then proceeded to CHARGE ME $9 TO CANCEL the order. Absolute scam, there's no way these 5 star reviews are real."
PupSocks,2020-12-26T15:28:46Z,1,I have not received my product yet and I ordered back in November. I am a disappointed. That may change once I receive my product.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T15:27:53Z,2,"I ordered 2 fall print socks in a men’s and women’s size. The patterns and printed image are really cute. Unfortunately the socks run really large, are cut like a tube without much of a heal shape and a wide toe, and are made from a stiff material that doesn’t form to the foot. I almost wonder if what I received was a mistake. Because of the large, shapeless form, no one can wear them, which is disappointing not only because of how much they cost but because my family was excited for the idea. I’m giving them 2 stars because of the nice look, but I would recommend ordering something other than socks."
PupSocks,2020-12-26T15:27:30Z,3,"The socks are super cute and the pics of our dog came out very nice. Unfortunately, they are cut straight without any place for the heel of the foot. When you try to put them in, they do not pull up well or go around the foot the way a sock should fit. They are not comfortable or do not fit a foot well. My daughter couldn’t even get hers on all the way. They are so cute. It’s sad that the kids won’t be able to wear them."
PupSocks,2020-12-26T15:26:52Z,5,Best Christmas gift ever. the recipient literally cried when they saw their sweet pups on the socks!
PupSocks,2020-12-26T15:25:47Z,5,I got these socks for my daughter for Christmas and she loved themHer cat  never looked better.Great product.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T15:24:35Z,5,I ordered these socks as Christmas gifts for four different dog owners and could not be happier with the quality of the images on the socks. Everyone loved them!
PupSocks,2020-12-26T15:24:17Z,1,"My biggest disappointment was in the quality of the socks. The picture was cute, the service timely, but the socks were so big and material not stretchy that they don't come even close to conforming to your foot. I bought the appropriate size for my college-aged daughter but they are huge. The excessive material in the footbed make them very uncomfortable and unwearable."
PupSocks,2020-12-26T15:23:48Z,1,"Well.... I ordered a very special blanket and socks for my mom up in Canada Nov 28th.  After hearing nothing after my order and the email saying it was it “pawduction” -the same day.... I reached out after I started to read reviews and suggestions to check out the bbb on Pupsocks.... dec 8th, I received a shipping confirmation Dec 8/9th. Dec 15th in Miami. Dec 24th cleared Canadian customs. If this order was shipped as promised when I ordered it, it would have arrived on time.  It was not processed until I followed back up on the 8th."
PupSocks,2020-12-26T15:22:53Z,1,"Placed my order on November 28th, hoping to give it as a Christmas gift. It’s now December 26, it has yet to arrive. So much for delivery within 8-10 days.It is now January 2nd, and I’m still waiting!!!!"
PupSocks,2020-12-26T15:22:05Z,4,The product is impeccable. The deliivery in Canada took arround 20 days. But got it in time for christmas.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T15:21:56Z,5,"These socks were awesome. The picture on them was really good quality, and the material of the sock was also good quality. The person who received them as a gift loved them!"
PupSocks,2020-12-26T15:21:36Z,5,Socks were a great gift for my husband!  Picture turned out perfect!
PupSocks,2020-12-26T15:21:27Z,1,Very cheap quality material. My boyfriend wears Funny socks for work but these don’t even look like socks. They have a weird plates lining in the inside. Extremely disappointed
PupSocks,2020-12-26T15:19:30Z,1,We received different color socks with another dog on them. Can’t get in touch with anyone at customer service. Awful company!!!
PupSocks,2020-12-26T15:19:11Z,1,"You guys suck. I ordered a Christmas gift for my sister back in November and it still hasn’t shipped a month later. A shipping label was generated but it’s still sitting in Georgia. When I asked about my order mid-December, I received an email from your customer service stating that all orders placed before December would get priority for shipping and that my item was finishing production on time. Neither was true. Thanks for embarrassing me and making me buy a replacement gift (which was an expense I shouldn’t have to bear because of your incompetence). Anyways - never again. I will never buy from you again. Despite the stupid 40% coupon you sent again CHRISTMAS EVE, along with a PHOTO MAKE-UP of what my sister was supposed to receive. It’s a small item but one she would have loved opening on Christmas."
PupSocks,2020-12-26T15:18:41Z,5,My daughter loved the socks with her cat's face.  The product quality was good and printing came out perfect.  Thanks!
PupSocks,2020-12-26T15:11:25Z,1,I never received the socks.  I reached out online more than a week ago and have still not even received a response.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T15:08:30Z,1,"Order 2 different pairs of socks and my order was emailed and confirmed correctly illustrating the pictures of the dogs with the requested amount of socks.  Received the socks and only had 1 pair of socks correct (ordered 2 pairs of the same dog and 1 was correct), the other sock was supposed to have two dogs on the sock and they only had one dog and received 1 pair of socks vs. two with two dogs.  Then I received two other pairs of socks with someone else's dog.  Emailed customer service immediately (no phone number available despite searching and received a generic email response stating they would get back in 24 hours and it has been over 2 weeks with no response. Reported to my credit card company."
PupSocks,2020-12-26T15:06:25Z,1,Ordered at the end of November for a Christmas present. Has not been received yet...
PupSocks,2020-12-26T15:03:10Z,1,"I am not going to give a good review because it took over 5 weeks to get my order and I reached out several times asking you to check on my order and never got a response. If you give us the option to message you, you should respond and not ignore."
PupSocks,2020-12-26T15:02:52Z,1,Orders in plenty of time for Christmas gift. 11/28. Still have not received. Do not even want any longer. Ridiculous
PupSocks,2020-12-26T14:57:27Z,1,Did not get the item I bought
PupSocks,2020-12-26T14:55:36Z,5,The pics look just like our dog and my son loved the socks!
PupSocks,2020-12-26T14:52:50Z,5,Awesome job!  Bought for my fiancée and she absolutely loved them!
PupSocks,2020-12-26T14:52:49Z,4,Adorable socks.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T14:51:26Z,2,Disappointing. Will not recommend to others. Over a month waiting for a Christmas gift that was guaranteed for before Christmas delivery. They blamed the postal service not the fact that it took a month for them to ship. Shop elsewhere.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T14:47:58Z,4,The socks are super cute.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T14:42:59Z,1,"Waiting 26+ days for a delivery of socks and my daughter missed getting them for Christmas.  For the price I paid for a pair of socks, I am very disappointed with the length of time to deliver the product!!"
PupSocks,2020-12-26T14:42:03Z,1,Never received my order which was ordered back in November. Wrote plenty of emails WITH NO RESPONSE. Then get a email on Christmas Eve with a “tag” of what gift should look like. Not even correct images!HORRIBLE COMPANY from Georgia and I live in the state!
PupSocks,2020-12-26T14:42:00Z,1,"Never received my order, have reached out numerous times and still haven't heard back from anyone. Will need a refund."
PupSocks,2020-12-26T14:39:24Z,1,I never received my package! I contacted the service and didnt heard from tou guys.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T14:35:32Z,1,"I ordered 4 pair of these socks 5+ weeks ago for Christmas presents. Christmas has now come and gone and I have not received them.*EDIT** Ordered on November 19. As of January 6:  STILL NO SOCKS!!!!EDIT 2** Received socks on January 9. 3 pairs were my dog, the 4th pair was someone else’s....Save your money"
PupSocks,2020-12-26T14:27:23Z,5,I got my family our dogs face and my son’s girlfriend’s family one of their chicken’s face on socks. I got texts immediately from their family saying how much they loved the socks. My family loved them too.   These socks were a HUGE hit at Christmas.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T14:26:01Z,5,I ordered two blankets and a pair of socks as Christmas gifts for my family members who are *obsessed* with their pets. They were by far the most favorite of gifts! The picture quality of the pets on the products was excellent and the blankets were super soft!! Highly recommend!
PupSocks,2020-12-26T14:25:12Z,5,I ordered two pair with different pictures and they were perfect!  I gave them to the pet owners who loved them.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T14:12:52Z,1,Ordered Nov 28 and didn’t receive in time for Christmas. Very disappointed.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T14:11:51Z,1,"Ordered on November 28th, its December 26th and the tracking just says ""label created"" - it hasn't even shipped! Should have known with that many Instagram and Facebook ads it was a scam."
PupSocks,2020-12-26T14:10:48Z,5,The socks arrived in time and were perfect
PupSocks,2020-12-26T14:09:52Z,1,Ordered for Christmas gift Nov 27th did not receive for Christmas...
PupSocks,2020-12-26T14:06:26Z,5,Great quality and the pictures were true to life.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T14:05:24Z,5,"I absolutely am in love with my custom blanket with the face of my Himalayan cat, Romeo, all over it. This has exceeded my expectations!"
PupSocks,2020-12-26T14:01:45Z,5,"Great quality socks!  I love seeing my precious little prince’s face every time I look down.  10/10, would recommend to any pet owner as a neat novelty gift."
PupSocks,2020-12-26T14:00:05Z,1,"Made an order in November. Was guarantied to have it before Christmas. Well, I still have not received my package. Not happy!!"
PupSocks,2020-12-26T13:53:13Z,1,Absolutely awful. Ordered at the start of December and still haven't arrived. So special Christmas present was spoilt. Only online order not to be delivered despite it being one of the first online purchases that I made.In short - never again
PupSocks,2020-12-26T13:46:15Z,2,The pictures were not clear and the quality was average at best considering the high cost. Wouldn’t buy them again.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T13:34:57Z,2,An email sent to review the socks when they were ordered a month ago and still haven’t arrived? I understand it’s Christmas and Covid however it was still disappointing.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T13:28:46Z,3,"Good product, just extremely slow. I ordered in November and item didn’t arrive until December 23rd which didn’t allow enough time to send them to family before Christmas. The product themselves look very cute - especially the masks."
PupSocks,2020-12-26T13:22:35Z,3,Fabric is not soft and the socks are ill fitting. Too big around the toes.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T13:20:14Z,5,"Cute! (Although I suppose it depends on your dog, but wait, is there any un-cute dogs?) Well made! These were the hit of Christmas. They are really cute and well made. We got the light blue and our friend's white labradodle's head really popped against the blue background. They have a nice feel and seemed true to size. The ordering was relatively fast given its a custom item and shipping was also reasonable. I would order again for another gift in a heartbeat."
PupSocks,2020-12-26T13:15:55Z,1,Didn’t receive anything yet!Xmas passed and nothing!
PupSocks,2020-12-26T13:12:40Z,5,Wonderful product- exactly how I pictured it would be and Grandma totally adored her grandsons and a grand pup on her socks!!!
PupSocks,2020-12-26T13:10:10Z,5,Loved the blanket and socks
PupSocks,2020-12-26T13:09:16Z,1,Ordered over a month ago and has been guaranteed delivery before Xmas. Very disappointed as they have yet to be received. Also no progress on tracker. They took the money immediately but no info on product delivery date. Dissatisfied!!
PupSocks,2020-12-26T13:03:24Z,1,"Totally dissatisfied.  I ordered 3 blankets on November 27.  Today is Dec 26 and I STILL don't have them.  No excuse ~ high volume, Covid  ~ no .  I ordered them in plenty of time to have by Christmas.  My credit card was charged the day I placed the order, AND the website was still guaranteeing Christmas delivery if you ordered by Dec. 12.   So not happy with this experience.  NEVER again."
PupSocks,2020-12-26T12:55:05Z,5,The pup socks were a present for my husband. The socks turned out great! The pups pictures were amazing!!!!
PupSocks,2020-12-26T12:41:08Z,1,I ordered my socks but never received them before Xmas
PupSocks,2020-12-26T12:40:06Z,5,They were a BIG hit. Thanks.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T12:05:37Z,3,I could give 5 stars for their service and the way the socks were printed.  It was done exactly as I specified and the images were clear.  The three star rating comes from the fact that the socks were so cheap that they are difficult to wear.  I would like to see them provide a higher  quality sock.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T11:55:11Z,4,"It takes some time (about a month) to get to you, but the product is great. :)"
PupSocks,2020-12-26T11:21:41Z,1,Ordered in November. Did not come in time for Christmas.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T10:20:33Z,1,"I ordered this product in November, hoping to gift it to two of my animal loving family members.  It is Dec. 25 and my pupsocks have still not arrived.  If there was a zero stars option to rate this product, I would have chosen to give pupsocks a zero."
PupSocks,2020-12-26T08:58:15Z,1,"Disgusting service, lack of customer support, and my order never showed up"
PupSocks,2020-12-26T08:57:58Z,1,Cheap material. Shipping takes forever. Poor communication. Wouldn’t buy again
PupSocks,2020-12-26T07:59:07Z,5,So very cute and a very popular Xmas present. Thank you from New Zealand
PupSocks,2020-12-26T07:56:54Z,2,I’m only giving a poor review because I have not received my order yet. Other than that you have had great communication and have been helpful with my questions
PupSocks,2020-12-26T07:36:43Z,3,Socks were not sent out as promised. They were very late. Then when they did come they were printed backwards.  The image on one side of the socks was superimposed. Then they were sent out again proper weeks later.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T07:16:15Z,5,This was the gift I was most excited about giving this year
PupSocks,2020-12-26T06:48:49Z,1,"I ordered a pair of socks and a gift box for them to come in. The socks were great, but I paid extra for the gift box that never came. When I emailed them about the issue, they sent me what appeared to be some sort of automated apology and then just a printable certificate with the picture of the product I bought. What good does that do lol? Cute socks but definitely not helpful with their customer service and I didn’t get my money back for the packaging."
PupSocks,2020-12-26T06:36:27Z,2,The material quality is very cheap they are very thin and kind of rough material. Also not true to size my daughter wears an 8 and I got her a medium and the are too tight she can’t even wear them. The only reason I gave a 2 star review is cause the pic turned out ok. Would not buy again and do not recommend.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T06:26:51Z,1,I ordered on November 21st and a week before Christmas a blanket showed up with the wrong blanket. The blanket that showed up was not my dog and was the wrong color. I can’t get a hold of customer service at all. They’ve ripped me off and the worst part is telling a child they didn’t get the blanket they wanted.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T06:26:22Z,4,The quality of the blanket was great.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T06:23:27Z,1,Ordered over a month  ago and had not arrived
PupSocks,2020-12-26T06:03:35Z,5,The blanket turned out amazing and my son was sooooo happy! Great personal gift for someone you love! I also had made a mistake on my order and they fixed it no problem!
PupSocks,2020-12-26T06:00:22Z,1,You guys suck! I still haven’t received my order that was placed over a month ago. Totally missed your Christmas deadline. Over priced and all  I get is your stupid soliciting emails. Hot Garbage company!
PupSocks,2020-12-26T05:55:04Z,1,"Awful. Sent completely the wrong order and never responded to my email. Have reported to the better business bureau... love supporting an American Business, but it is malpractice to allow a scam like this. Hoping there was a way to straighten it all out"
PupSocks,2020-12-26T05:41:41Z,1,Ordered them for a Christmas present and they sent me the wrong order with somebody’s else pets ?!?!?
PupSocks,2020-12-26T05:26:38Z,1,I still have not received more order from Nov 19-
PupSocks,2020-12-26T05:19:15Z,3,The socks look great but the sizing was a little small and the socks are very boxy. Hopefully they are more comfortable as I wear/wash them
PupSocks,2020-12-26T05:08:07Z,5,"My 12 year-old son LOVES his cat. One of the items on his Christmas list was “surprise me with something you know I will love”. Purchased the large cat blanket, mission accomplished-He LOVES it. Prompt, and efficient. I will buy again."
PupSocks,2020-12-26T05:00:49Z,5,The socks I ordered turned out perfect!  The pictures I provided were not top notch yet you'd never know based off the final product.  It was a delightful gift for the dog to give the family.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T05:00:20Z,5,Everyone LOVED their pup socks!  Definitely recommend! Big hit!  Thank you!
PupSocks,2020-12-26T04:57:07Z,5,"Socks came on time, and the cropping was just right. Recipient loved them, great gift for a pet lover!"
PupSocks,2020-12-26T04:50:33Z,2,Ordered a month early and not here for Xmas. Too bad
PupSocks,2020-12-26T04:40:12Z,5,Wife and kids loved them
PupSocks,2020-12-26T04:29:15Z,1,Took too long to make/ship. Ordered Nov 27 and missed Christmas. That isn’t fast delivery. Frankly I wouldn’t have bothered. Disappointed in Pup socks and won’t buy again.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T04:24:18Z,1,"I ordered my gift a month ago and it never arrived. The shipping updates tell me nothing about where my socks are and if they’ll ever even arrive. All I wanted was for my husband to receive them on Christmas morning. My email inbox is flooded with your marketing emails, but nothing about where my order actually is. I just have to hope that the socks will still arrive and that I haven’t been scammed!!!"
PupSocks,2020-12-26T04:09:51Z,5,"Really cute gift idea! Bought them for 2 different people, who loved them."
PupSocks,2020-12-26T04:05:19Z,5,Excellent quality of photos on the socks and easy to access customer service
PupSocks,2020-12-26T04:04:20Z,1,"Haven’t even received my order and I’m being asked to write a review, says it all really! Placed an order for a Xmas present on 28th November, 1 month later and no sign of it! Unable to track through the courier details provided and when I contact customer service I am either ignored or receive a generic response."
PupSocks,2020-12-26T04:04:09Z,2,"I ordered a pair of socks before Thanksgiving. Emailed 3 times, with no explanation of why my order was on hold for two weeks. So now I don’t have a Christmas gift for someone. All I read on your site was how fast your production was 🙄"
PupSocks,2020-12-26T04:02:35Z,5,very fun cool thing to get a pet lover
PupSocks,2020-12-26T03:59:24Z,5,My son loved it!
PupSocks,2020-12-26T03:58:12Z,1,Was sent the wrong order...after I waited a month for it.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T03:57:18Z,5,Bought the “Dog Dad” socks with our bulldog’s face for my boyfriend as a Christmas present. I was so excited to give them to him as he would never guess what the gift was. He LOVED them!Order was made and shipped quickly. Very happy! Definitely want to order again.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T03:53:22Z,5,very cool socks
PupSocks,2020-12-26T03:36:52Z,1,The design of the pet is fine but the quality of the actual socks is awful. The low quality is almost comical.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T03:35:00Z,5,Pictures came out great and fantastic customer service too! My wife was super thrilled with them!
PupSocks,2020-12-26T03:27:27Z,5,The socks arrived on time for Christmas and they look great. Thanks
PupSocks,2020-12-26T03:25:56Z,5,The socks were awesome. I got 6 different pairs for Christmas gifts. They were such a hit. Everyone lives them. And I got them in a very timely fashion
PupSocks,2020-12-26T03:07:25Z,1,Ordered in November didn’t receive for Xmas. Customer service also never got back to me. Not sure if it’s been shipped or if I should dispute the charges on my Cc 🤷🏻‍♀️
PupSocks,2020-12-26T03:01:58Z,1,No delivery after 6 weeks. Contacted customer service multiple times with no response.Still no sign of arrival.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T02:58:36Z,5,My kids loved the socks. Would definitely order again.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T02:51:32Z,1,"Ugly service...my package should be arrive on 10-15 december.... 58$ for 2 pair of socks for my sons as a christmas gift..... NO RECEIVED... and they write an email for a ""survey"" .... come on🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️"
PupSocks,2020-12-26T02:42:14Z,1,"The image on the socks was cropped even though I did not expect or want it to be. I sent several emails to the company but they never responded! Not at all impressed with their customer service, I at least expected a response."
PupSocks,2020-12-26T02:24:41Z,1,Horrible/no customer service! Put incorrect picture on my socks and would not respond to any form of communication to resolve the problem.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T02:16:46Z,5,I was very pleased with PupSocks. The ordering process was very easy. My order was confirmed and initiated very quickly. For a custom made product I was very pleased with the speed of my delivery.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T02:15:51Z,1,"I placed my orders on Black Friday and today is Christmas and my gifts have still not arrived. I understand that likely an influx of orders and the impact of COVID lent to the delay, however I was very disappointed that my presents did not arrive on time, yet this review email was sent to me and I don’t even have the orders in my possession."
PupSocks,2020-12-26T02:15:47Z,5,"Excellent product!! So easy to order, came quickly, and it is the softest blanket. Could not be happier!!"
PupSocks,2020-12-26T02:13:08Z,1,I still have not received my order which was purchased on 11/27/20. I am terribly disappointed with the company
PupSocks,2020-12-26T02:12:23Z,5,Printing job was great. Fit of socks was kind of weird
PupSocks,2020-12-26T02:09:19Z,5,Quality blanket. Nicely made and picture of pet looks good. Daughter was very happy.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T02:03:43Z,5,Great product.Fast shipping would buy again
PupSocks,2020-12-26T01:55:35Z,5,I ordered a blanket & sock combo and added a face mask for my daughter that had her cat featured on all of them. I think it was one of her FAVORITE gifts this Christmas. She shrieked when she opened it! Great products!
PupSocks,2020-12-26T01:49:32Z,5,He was soo excited when he opened this gift! The pic of his dog was super cute and looked amazing on the socks!!
PupSocks,2020-12-26T01:47:54Z,5,Easy process and quality product. Were given as gifts and definitely brought smiles!
PupSocks,2020-12-26T01:41:10Z,5,Ordering was easy and the socks turned out fabulous! I was very impressed with the quality of the image. Top-notch product!
PupSocks,2020-12-26T01:37:02Z,5,The cropped the picture of our beloved poodle PERFECTLY!
PupSocks,2020-12-26T01:36:21Z,1,I ordered 2 pair socks in November for Christmas gifts. They never showed up and I cannot get an update on my order.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T01:33:03Z,1,My socks arrived with the incorrect picture on them.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T01:32:24Z,3,"The socks look good, a great job was done editing the picture and isolating my dog’s head.  The sock sizing and quality is not what I expected."
PupSocks,2020-12-26T01:31:03Z,5,The images are great and they are comfortable!!!!! Good job
PupSocks,2020-12-26T01:27:13Z,5,Your socks made our holiday gift giving a true delight. Everyone was so happy and the printing was perfect. Well done!
PupSocks,2020-12-26T01:26:25Z,1,"The socks were way too wide at the toes and way too narrow at the ankles making them unwearable.  Although they are cute, I would not waste money on them.  I am asking for a refund.  We'll see if they provide it."
PupSocks,2020-12-26T01:25:10Z,5,Very good quality!
PupSocks,2020-12-26T01:20:34Z,5,"Excellent cropping of the face, my dad seems to really like them! Oh, and they actually got here on time!"
PupSocks,2020-12-26T01:00:37Z,5,Great product!
PupSocks,2020-12-26T00:49:06Z,4,I ordered on November 26th and have not received the gift yet. It is disappointing but I hope to receive it soon and can then comment more as I have not seen the product yet.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T00:38:22Z,3,"The quality of the print was exceptional, however the socks themselves are unwearable. They are 5 sizes too big and yet they bunch up on the front of the ankle where you foot naturally bends so they don’t even make sense as socks. We threw them away. Again, the quality of the print itself was outstanding."
PupSocks,2020-12-26T00:23:45Z,5,Love our dog’s picture on the socks. Wish the socks were fluffy and warmer....
PupSocks,2020-12-26T00:19:25Z,2,"I’m still waiting for my blanket. Ordered on November 27th, it was supposed to be a Christmas gift but haven’t received it yet???"
PupSocks,2020-12-26T00:18:54Z,5,"Socks looked like my cat, recipient loved gift"
PupSocks,2020-12-26T00:17:13Z,5,A hit at Christmas time! Our daughter loved getting a personal gift with her fur baby’s face! Great gift...highly recommend.
PupSocks,2020-12-26T00:13:58Z,5,Awesome product! My son in loved it. Thank You!
PupSocks,2020-12-26T00:07:19Z,5,The socks and service were great!
PupSocks,2020-12-26T00:06:12Z,1,Ordered 2 blankets on 11/27.  One blanket was received 12/22 with the wrong pictures on it.  The 2nd blanket still hasn’t been received as of 12/25.  Both were supposed to be Christmas gifts.  No response to emails from the company. Would appreciate a refund as company failed to deliver products.
PupSocks,2020-12-25T23:57:03Z,5,This is the second year I have ordered socks from y’all and I love them so much! I have given them as gifts and each time the recipient has been so happy. The quality is amazing too - it looks exactly like the picture and the print seems high quality. They hold up well in the wash too. Will probably be ordering again next year.
PupSocks,2020-12-25T23:57:00Z,1,"Website states international orders will be delivered in 8-15 days... it's been a month since I placed my order and I never received anything.  I tried to cancel my order and get a refund since my order never arrived, and I was refunded about $20 of the roughly $38 my order came to.  The day after I was refunded I received an email saying my order has been shipped... guess I'll wait and see if it ever shows up?  Worst company to order from ever.  I sent 2 separate inqueries and have not received a single response.  Don't waste your time or money on this company!!!"
PupSocks,2020-12-25T23:56:46Z,5,Gave them as Christmas gifts and they were a big hit ! Everyone loved them !  Buying some more soon !
PupSocks,2020-12-25T23:55:15Z,1,I ordered near thanksgiving and my package still didn’t arrive before Christmas.
PupSocks,2020-12-25T23:54:25Z,3,Cute novelty gift but not a good or true fitting sock.
PupSocks,2020-12-25T23:45:33Z,5,"Socks were a big hit, my boys loved them. Picture was clear."
PupSocks,2020-12-25T23:43:18Z,3,"First, the order took way too long to arrive. Even though the idea is great , the quality of the socks isn’t good; they are really tight and definitely not true to size. Ordered two pairs for my husband and my son and they could barely put them on. The face masks were way better, a little bit too small and they came with the small rubber things to attach and tighten. Would love to know how to put them. 🤷‍♀️"
PupSocks,2020-12-25T23:33:42Z,1,First time and last time I will use this service. I understand being busy and backordered but timely service and communication are key to success and they can’t deliver on those. I’m sorry to write this because I like the idea of the business and their products but not this poor of service. I ordered socks nov 26 and didn’t receive any update until December 18 after I reached out to ask for an update. They still haven’t delivered and it’s Dec 25 now. I am still asking for a refund and have not heard back yet.
PupSocks,2020-12-25T23:30:10Z,1,Still have not received items. It’s been three weeks since order. No response from company
PupSocks,2020-12-25T23:26:31Z,5,My order was a quick delivery and my sister lovers her gift. We just recently lost our childhood dog from old age so it was nice to give her something to remind her of him. He gave us all MAGIC (his name). Thank you so much!
PupSocks,2020-12-25T23:18:32Z,2,"Ordered these socks over three weeks ago and just a couple of days ago I get am email saying they are delayed.  Their address is in Atlanta and I live only 35 miles from there.  Looks like a cool product, but no idea if they are any good in quality.  They certainly are not very good in communication and production."
PupSocks,2020-12-25T23:18:09Z,5,I had my socks sent to Australia. They arrived well before Xmas which was great.
PupSocks,2020-12-25T23:16:47Z,4,Great pup socks! Very easy to order and they arrived in a short time.Bought them for my family and they loved them.Thanks!
PupSocks,2020-12-25T23:09:42Z,5,Great product. Easy process. Ordered socks and blanket. Very good quality and good shipping.
PupSocks,2020-12-25T23:02:50Z,5,Fantastic experience. Great product. Quick delivery!
PupSocks,2020-12-25T23:00:28Z,5,I purchased 4 pairs for family and friends for Christmas gifts. Everyone loved them. They thought they were the absolutely the BEST giftEver.
PupSocks,2020-12-25T22:59:13Z,1,Ordered in November as a Christmas present; still haven’t arrived. I contacted Pupsocks but havent heard back from them. Definitely won’t be using again.
PupSocks,2020-12-25T22:55:14Z,5,These socks turned out great. I also appreciated the updates on my order.
PupSocks,2020-12-25T22:54:03Z,5,I got 3 pairs of socks with cat pictures and everyone who received a pair really loved them.
PupSocks,2020-12-25T22:53:18Z,5,"I was very happy with the quality of the printing, the follow up from the company, and the thoughtfulness to include mock up cards incase our socks didn't make it in time for the holiday. So impressed, will be purchasing from you again!"
PupSocks,2020-12-25T22:44:45Z,1,Complete joke of a company a month and counting to still not get socks? Pathetic.
PupSocks,2020-12-25T22:44:03Z,5,I got these for my fiancé for Christmas and he plans to wear them at our wedding so our dog can be with us.
PupSocks,2020-12-25T22:43:46Z,3,Very neat idea but the socks aren't very comfortable.  More of a novelty than useful.
PupSocks,2020-12-25T22:40:45Z,1,I guess I did not research what I was ordering I was just excited to get this mask with dogs on it for my bestie.  I am disappointed in the product especially for the price it seems very chintzy and the straps appear as though they are stretched out and I’m not even sure I want to gift it to her.  Was super deflated upon receipt!
PupSocks,2020-12-25T22:30:33Z,1,"I ordered a blanket on Nov. 25, and as of Dec. 25 I still have not received my order. The order was not completed in 8-10 business days as advertised on the website. In that time, I moved and had to change shipping addresses. However, when I contacted customer service about this, they did respond until several days later. Then they canceled my original order and created a new order, which is now over a month delayed. I understand that shipping nationwide is delayed because of Covid-19 and unprecedented shipping volume, but the extremely slow customer service is unacceptable. And my second email asking about the status of my order was never answered. I will not be ordering from Pupsocks again."
PupSocks,2020-12-25T22:28:39Z,5,"I ordered a pet blanket as a gift and my recipient said it was the BEST Christmas gift she ever got!!  Soft and cozy, with all her pets’ faces!"
PupSocks,2020-12-25T22:23:46Z,4,I love the blanket and would of given it 5 stars but the reason I am not is that I wish there was a preview of what it looked like before processing. I have 2 dogs and wish I would of been able to change my picture of the one.
PupSocks,2020-12-25T22:22:16Z,5,Bought these as a gift and they were very appreciated.
PupSocks,2020-12-25T22:11:03Z,1,This was a terrible purchase and no way to contact customer service. They got my order completely wrong. I dont even have my dogs face on 1 pair I purchased. I am very disappointed
PupSocks,2020-12-25T22:07:35Z,1,"Absolutely terrible. Its a complete scam as the product didn't turn up, wouldn't reccomed to anyone"
PupSocks,2020-12-25T22:05:14Z,5,"My daughter loves her blanket and socks. They turned out so well, they did justice to an ugly cat lol."
PupSocks,2020-12-25T22:04:48Z,5,The socks really made my daughter’s day!
PupSocks,2020-12-25T22:02:36Z,5,Turned out super cute!!
PupSocks,2020-12-25T22:02:29Z,1,Is this a joke? You mailed me an empty bag and don’t take customer emails or calls?! I still haven’t gotten my money back
PupSocks,2020-12-25T22:01:38Z,3,"Good likeness of my dog, but unwearable as socks. The fabric is just too unsocklike and doesn’t stay up well."
PupSocks,2020-12-25T21:56:38Z,3,"The socks are adorable but not comfortable, warm or soft."
PupSocks,2020-12-25T21:49:38Z,1,Can’t make a review yet as have not received them.  I guess I’ll give them to kids next year 🙁Once I get them then I’ll review.
PupSocks,2020-12-25T21:32:28Z,1,I wish there was a way I could give you a zero rating.  I ordered a blanket from you on thanksgiving day and I never received it. I was looking forward to give it as a gift and that never happened.  I had to cancel my order three days before Christmas because I could not get a email back from your business asking where it was. There was no goodwill towards any pups.  Very disheartened customer....
PupSocks,2020-12-25T21:28:22Z,5,My husband and son were very excited to get their pup socks for Christmas this year. Our dog Remi looks so cute on them. It was so easy to upload a photo and place my order.  Nice work
PupSocks,2020-12-25T21:27:24Z,5,The socks were a big hit! Both pairs came out great and my wife and daughter love them.
PupSocks,2020-12-25T21:26:32Z,5,Perfect!! Exactly what I expected and kids loved it!!!
PupSocks,2020-12-25T21:25:04Z,1,"The quality and fit are very poor for the price paid. I honestly thought it would be better.    Material is cheap feeling.  They do not form to an average foot, they are just straight, tube like, unlike most socks that are curved.  Lots of bunching in the ankle.  No heel bed. Toes are very wide and leaves lots of excess material which bunches up in your shoes (and yes I ordered the right size)   My roommate ordered socks from another company, for the same price, and are much better quality.  Leaving me disappointed.  Sorry I can't give you a better review than that. If your reading this and are looking to buy, I would look around for better quality.  It's out there."
PupSocks,2020-12-25T21:25:02Z,1,Been waiting well over a month. Noone has replied to my multiple emails. Finally recieved an email with a picture of my order because shipping is unknown. Horrible customer service. I'm sure I'll eventually receive my socks. Disappointed to say the least.
PupSocks,2020-12-25T21:21:21Z,4,Amazing products! Only reason for not giving 5 stars is that production and shipping took a long time...
PupSocks,2020-12-25T21:18:53Z,5,Perfect Christmas present for my boyfriend who loves his dogs! The blankets are really soft and printed photo quality is amazing.
PupSocks,2020-12-25T21:08:02Z,1,I ordered socks over 5 weeks ago for a Christmas present and never received them. The tracking number tells me they're still in Georgia where the process started. Each time i contact support i never hear back. Absolutely would've put that money towards another gift.
PupSocks,2020-12-25T21:06:37Z,5,They kept me in the loop as far as the progress with my order and delivered on time.  The socks were a hit.
PupSocks,2020-12-25T21:04:09Z,5,Great product
PupSocks,2020-12-25T21:00:10Z,5,I gave these to my daughter for Christmas. It had her two dogs on them. Absolutely loved them!!  Keep up the awesome work!!
PupSocks,2020-12-25T20:58:33Z,5,"These socks are fantastic!  My son hasn't opened his Christmas gifts yet, but I know he will absolutely love them!"
PupSocks,2020-12-25T20:56:06Z,5,"Probably THEEEE best gift I ever got my young adult kids!!!  The quality of the socks is great but the photos ARE AWESOME!!!!  I will ABSOLUTELY be buying more items! And also, the customer service is AMAZING!!!! Such a wonderful and pleasantly surprising experience."
PupSocks,2020-12-25T20:55:58Z,5,Our children loved the socks with their dog’s pic on them! The socks fit well and we all made a memory with our pup socks.
PupSocks,2020-12-25T20:55:18Z,5,Got this for a christmas present for my daughters boyfriend and he loves it
PupSocks,2020-12-25T20:53:35Z,5,I ordered a blanket for my daughter and it was her favorite Christmas gift.
PupSocks,2020-12-25T20:52:43Z,2,"I placed a ""bundles"" order which was a blanket & socks combo but forgot to indicate sock size so the company only processed the blanket.  When I asked them to kindly process the socks they declined to do so saying it wasn't indicated on the order which I know I did order but forgot to select the size and that's why it was overlooked.  Not impressed at all with the customer service and will never order from this Company again, not a good thing when they are ripping off customers but not fulfilling the entire order."
PupSocks,2020-12-25T20:46:42Z,1,Lied too about arrival date. Waste of money at this point
PupSocks,2020-12-25T20:45:32Z,4,"Texture of the socks are kinda strange, but we still love them"
PupSocks,2020-12-25T20:43:05Z,5,Loved the socks! Well made too! Had 3 different cat head shots of my daughter’s cat who had recently passed away. Now she has a memory to keep close to her...
PupSocks,2020-12-25T20:40:48Z,1,Did not send complete order. Sent socks with the wrong picture. Slow to respond to messages for help. Company does not have a phone number. + finally responded with a solution to the problem.
PupSocks,2020-12-25T20:40:30Z,5,I was honestly on the fence to order these socks because I was scared the picture I was using wasn’t clear enough. When the socks finally came in I was so shocked and pleased with the results! The picture of my dogs face was cropped perfectly and looked so clear!
PupSocks,2020-12-25T20:40:10Z,4,I felt the pictures used were cropped a little too much so the dog’s ears were nearly cut off. My sister will still love what I got her!
PupSocks,2020-12-25T20:39:07Z,2,"The make up of a order that was wrong was suppose to be delivered December 24th by 9:00pm. They never received them. Feel bad because I had ordered these quite awhile ago, so they would have them early. I started to place an order for something else and decided I would wait to see if they got their corrected order.Thank you for your time.Sincerely Carol Sheldon"
PupSocks,2020-12-25T20:38:29Z,5,Got them as gifts for my brother and his partner. Turned out awesome and they were so happy!
PupSocks,2020-12-25T20:37:37Z,5,I had a mask with my sons dog on it. It was the perfect gift! He loved it! The mask is good quality and the image looks great!
PupSocks,2020-12-25T20:32:13Z,5,I loved them so much I ordered another pair!
PupSocks,2020-12-25T20:28:46Z,1,"The mock up looks nothing like the blanket layout I ordered, not to mention shipping is delayed PAST CHRISTMAS without any heads up and the “mockup” copy they sent on CHRISTMAS EVE is beyond terrible. I haven’t received the blanket yet so I can’t comment on the quality of the actual material, but if it’s anything like the photo they sent me, I will be returning it."
PupSocks,2020-12-25T20:28:09Z,1,"I ordered these on November 27 and still have not received them. Hard to review something I paid for, but still don’t have."
PupSocks,2020-12-25T20:25:04Z,4,"The ordering process was easy and quick. The faces on the socks were exactly what I hoped for, but the actual material used for the socks seemed kind of cheap to me. Maybe it's because of the fact that they need to be able to print on the socks, but they do not seem comfortable to wear. These were gifts to two different people and they both loved them when they saw them. Let's hope they're more comfortable than they look."
PupSocks,2020-12-25T20:20:46Z,5,Well received as a Xmas gift today!
PupSocks,2020-12-25T20:17:59Z,1,I ordered socks the day after Thanksgiving and did not receive them by Christmas.  No updates or indications that was the case.  Horrible customer service with zero response.  I would never order again!!
PupSocks,2020-12-25T20:16:48Z,1,"Socks did not fit correctly even though I bought the right size. Material was cheap. While the photo of the dog looked good, I could not recommend you or purchase from you again. I think I should get a refund as $25+ for a pair of poorly made socks is excessive. Very dissatisfied."
PupSocks,2020-12-25T20:15:49Z,1,"If I could give less than one star, I would! Absolutely terrible. I ordered one pair of socks almost two months ago. They finally sent me a pair with a random cat on them, NOT my two dogs. It’s nearly impossible to get anyone from customer service to respond. You literally have to send 5-6 emails a day to get a generic response. Still waiting on the correct pair to get here. Not counting on it. Filed a complaint with BBB! Beware before buying. Please save your money and use a more reputable company."
PupSocks,2020-12-25T20:09:20Z,4,"Really cute socks with good image quality. The first time you wear them they feel a little odd because of how they are sent, but they are fine after the first wash."
PupSocks,2020-12-25T20:08:54Z,5,I bought 2 pairs of socks as gifts. They were amazing and loved by the recipients
PupSocks,2020-12-25T20:05:49Z,5,These socks are adorable! One pair of socks was not my dog and customer service quickly remedied the situation. Highly recommend this product for a cute custom gift !
PupSocks,2020-12-25T19:56:48Z,5,They loved their Christmas gift. Thank you!
PupSocks,2020-12-25T19:55:32Z,4,The socks are awesome and the only reason I gave 4 rather than 5 stars is because the fit isn’t the best. I would say they run small.
PupSocks,2020-12-25T19:53:19Z,1,"Order over 1 month ago and still don’t have it. It’s a mask. You’re not making a rocket going to the moon. Your web site sucks as there is no phone number for customer service and when I email, no one responds with follow up info. I will never buy from you again."
PupSocks,2020-12-25T19:53:04Z,1,Very cute idea.  However the socks are not shaped like socks.  They’re more like super thick old lady stockings in an unusual fabric.  I never would have purchased 5 pair if I knew they weren’t actually socks.   They’re super uncomfortable:
PupSocks,2020-12-25T19:52:49Z,5,These socks are the best! They came out even better than we thought.
PupSocks,2020-12-25T19:52:39Z,5,Very happy ordering from Pupsocks. The order was fast and delivered in great time from USA to Canada.
PupSocks,2020-12-25T19:52:26Z,1,"I ordered a Christmas gift in November and it did not arrive by Christmas (which is today). The website said it would process within 3 days. The processing time was longer than that. Order has been sitting in pre-shipment status for 2 weeks. They should not have accepted my order if they could not fulfill it. I could have ordered it from another place and it would have arrived by Christmas. It’s just disappointing that I could not give it to the recipient on Christmas. I have no idea when it will arrive and the recipient doesn’t live in the area, so I will have to ship it to them if it ever arrives."
PupSocks,2020-12-25T19:50:49Z,5,Great looking socks that were easy to order and came very fast.
PupSocks,2020-12-25T19:47:51Z,1,"Ordered 5 masks on 11/27/20. Per company, order promised to ship within 5 to 10 days. Credit card charged for order. After 10 days order not received. Emailed company representative (Daneen) numerous times regarding order not being received. Kept being told order was still “ in production”. Upon checking order status NUMEROUS times & still being told order “in production” , email sent stating I could receive a 15% discount for delay or could cancel order & receive full refund. Opted for the discount with order promised to be shipped out within 10 days. As of 12/24/20 order NOT received. Had to call credit card company to request refund as no merchandise received. Also put in a complaint to the Better Business Bureau about this company. Was told this company has a very poor rating wit the BBB. I would NEVER order from this company again & would NOT recommend others to order from this company. They are a rip off!!!!"
PupSocks,2020-12-25T19:47:33Z,4,Wished they were cotton socks for the price
PupSocks,2020-12-25T19:44:08Z,1,If I could go less I would. An entire Facebook group devoted to their scam and an F rating from better business bureau. Do your homework!! No product. Wrong product. Blaming others. Not shipping but creating labels. It’s a disgrace
PupSocks,2020-12-25T19:42:12Z,1,The quality of the socks is poor. My daughter (for whom I bought them) said she would never put whatever mystery material they are on her body. The pictures also seem a bit distorted. Cute idea not realized.
PupSocks,2020-12-25T19:41:32Z,2,The quality of these socks is terrible. There’s no bend for the heel so it’s too tight in that area and the foot part is way too long with no shape. Overall I’m pretty disappointed and will not be purchasing again.
PupSocks,2020-12-25T19:39:01Z,5,"Bought them as Xmas gifts for my sons, 23 and 21 yrs. A huge hit :) Who doesn’t want socks with their cat’s face on them?"
PupSocks,2020-12-25T19:35:28Z,5,Always love the socks when I order them.
PupSocks,2020-12-25T19:34:57Z,5,Great experience.  Easy to order and showed up quickly/
PupSocks,2020-12-25T19:34:21Z,2,"The material is super slick like plastic. They do not feel cozy, warm, or wearable. Picture is not great quality. Overall a big disappointment for the price."
PupSocks,2020-12-25T19:33:56Z,3,"I love the idea of this. I wish the quality of the sock material was better, but still very cute with my granddaughters pictures on them."
PupSocks,2020-12-25T19:32:03Z,1,"Custom socks marked as shipped, never posted to USPS. When they finally did ship a week later and I received them another 8 days later(due to USPS delays) they were the wrong socks. Not my dog, not even the color I ordered. By then it was too late as they were to be a Christmas gift. No receipt, no packing slip. Subsequent attempts to contact customer service have yielded no response. Maybe $25 isn’t much to anyone at this company, but I work too hard to flush even that down the toilet."
PupSocks,2020-12-25T19:28:10Z,1,Never received any correspondence back from anyone in regards to where the product was. Didn't receive tracking for the package till at least 2 weeks after and the product isn't here yet and it was supposed to be here before Christmas. I ordered it on the 27th of November. Horrible customer service and will never order again.
PupSocks,2020-12-25T19:27:48Z,5,Ordered a blanket with my parents two dogs and it far exceeded my expectations. It turned out so beautiful. It came just in time for Christmas. They even sent me a mock up of the blanket on a cute card just in case it didn’t make it on time.I would highly recommend them on making your memory blanket.
PupSocks,2020-12-25T19:26:46Z,5,We love them.
PupSocks,2020-12-25T19:24:17Z,5,Came just like the pic amazing job
PupSocks,2020-12-25T19:21:53Z,2,"Very poor quality socks. The picture of my dog was cute, but that’s the extent of my pleasure with this purchase."
PupSocks,2020-12-25T19:17:32Z,5,Love the socks! Thanks for putting them together and following the notes!
PupSocks,2020-12-25T19:17:24Z,5,Loved our socks of our babies!!!! Great presents!!!
PupSocks,2020-12-25T19:16:42Z,1,"These socks are printed well according to my instructions, but they actual socks are not good. They  are literally just tubes (not sock shaped)  and have an awkward fit that is very wide as well. The cut of the sock is not fit for a foot at all, so it gets wrinkles on the front of the ankle and does not fit symmetrically. Cool idea, not a good product. I regret paying so much for my pairs, especially since they took 2.5 weeks to leave the facility for shipping and never responded to my customer service inquiry."
PupSocks,2020-12-25T19:15:57Z,5,We absolutely love our blanket.  The pups look awesome and the blanket is so soft.
PupSocks,2020-12-25T19:08:35Z,5,Very cute and made a great Christmas gift!
PupSocks,2020-12-25T19:07:13Z,5,I ordered 4 pairs with low expectations just hoping for a good laugh on Christmas.  But the socks were better quality than I thought and the pictures were perfect. Good image quality.  Best part is they arrived before Christmas.  I see more orders in my future.
PupSocks,2020-12-25T19:06:50Z,1,Still haven’t received them
PupSocks,2020-12-25T19:03:58Z,5,Amazing job. They look perfect.  Company did an amazing job. My wife loved them.
PupSocks,2020-12-25T19:03:31Z,5,"The socks were a hit, and the favorite gift of the season!"
PupSocks,2020-12-25T19:01:41Z,1,"Terrible product, terrible customer service"
PupSocks,2020-12-25T18:58:43Z,1,"Promised delivery for Christmas, didn’t arrive, no reply from the emails asking for a refund. Will be initiating a Visa chargeback shortly."
PupSocks,2020-12-25T18:58:42Z,5,The are so fun!  What a great unexpected gift.
PupSocks,2020-12-25T18:56:03Z,1,Ordered over a month ago for a Xmas present still not here. Not happy
PupSocks,2020-12-25T18:48:42Z,5,These were a Christmas gift. The pictures I chose worked out great. Very nice work on the socks.
PupSocks,2020-12-25T18:45:42Z,1,I ordered my items weeks before Christmas and have yet to receive them. When I emailed it took me sending to emails and not getting a date they should be here. Your website says 3-5 days! So you have cost me more money and I had a heart broken kid when she couldn’t  give the gift she picked out! Very disappointed and I hope my product shows us soon. COVID or not you need to have a phone number to be able to connect with your customers. It’s is a shame!!
PupSocks,2020-12-25T18:44:27Z,1,"I was told 8-10 days when I ordered Now over a month and usps still haven’t even received the item. I was told there would be a little delay and told I would be given a 50% off coupon for my troubles. No coupon. I email for help, no response. I was given a ‘virtual’ printable gift and it was not even correct. It’s now Christmas and my item has not even shipped yet, hard to understand how this company is in business."
PupSocks,2020-12-25T18:41:44Z,5,These socks are the best and they last forever. I just bought a replacement pair for my husband after his last pair finally gave out. He wore them at least weekly for three years.
PupSocks,2020-12-25T18:41:37Z,1,"Overpriced, delayed shipping and disappointing quality!I ordered two custom face masks in November for Christmas.  In spite of what they claim is a one-day production turnaround, they waited over two weeks before even  “creating a shipping label”, and then the package got stuck in usps limbo.The estimated delivery date FINALLY (Christmas week) came through as 12/26 - and I therefore scrambled to get replacement gifts.The package ultimately was delivered on 12/23 - but I was relieved to have secured replacement gifts — because the masks were so “cheap”.  The images were ok, but the masks were skimpy and the fabric quality mediocre.  The ear loops are HUGE - which means there is no way these masks can be worn without cutting the loops down.  They are elastic - why would you make them ridiculously big?  The only answer I could figure was lazy and hurried production.The company attempted to pacify customers who might experience delayed shipping by sending an emailed “order mock-up” to present if the gift didn’t arrive in time; but the mock-up only had one of 3 images, and was not in the ordered colors (and therefore bore very little resemblance to the product ordered).These MIGHT have been worth $3 - but certainly not the $20-ish paid for each one.I am hugely disappointed in the company and the product."
PupSocks,2020-12-25T18:41:36Z,5,I bought them for my children for Christmas and they loved them!!!
PupSocks,2020-12-25T18:38:03Z,1,"Purchased in November for a Christmas gift and it didn’t arrive even though it was promised for Christmas delivery.  Emailed customer service, no response."
PupSocks,2020-12-25T18:34:07Z,1,"I ordered and paid for custom socks prior to Thanksgiving, with the assumption that since they were made in the USA, I would receive them by Christmas.  That wasn't the case.  The gift was for a very sick relative that would have appreciated them. The tracking number is fake and useless.  There is no one-on-one customer communication with the company for follow-up.  I recieved a single computer generated email blaming too many orders and COVID for the delay.  The local Post Office rep denies any long COVID delay and says the order was actually never shipped from the company.  Apparently, MANY customers have similar disappointing experiences. I am very upset with this situation and assume that I will never get the socks. I willl soon be notifying the BBB, Consumer Fraud Protection Agency, Attorney General's Office in Georgia & Florida, and a personal attorney."
PupSocks,2020-12-25T18:30:03Z,5,Amazing!!!!
PupSocks,2020-12-25T18:24:42Z,5,The blanket i ordered came out great. The images of our dogs were spot on and my daughter was completely blown away that it was her dogs that were actually on her new blanket.
PupSocks,2020-12-25T18:23:35Z,1,Ordered my socks on Black Friday and still have not received them (they were supposed to be a Christmas gift). I don't even have a tracking number. Emailed customer support about a week ago and have not heard back.
PupSocks,2020-12-25T18:22:03Z,2,1. Our order took 3 weeks despite a promise of “ships next day”.2. Two emails requesting status updates went unanswered for more than the 48 hours promised.3. We did hear back once shipment had occurred.4. Subsequently we were offered a virtual option to share a picture for customers whose shipment was delayed.  This was not relevant to us.5. And now we seem to get 3-4 emails a week - ugh.
PupSocks,2020-12-25T18:21:56Z,3,"Ordered two items on Dec 8th and it was mentioned ""Get in time for Christmas"" now not arriving until Dec 26th, super upset because this was a gift from dad, and I paid over $200 for my orders.  One item arrived, looks good, but this was a Christmas present."
PupSocks,2020-12-25T18:17:30Z,5,My daughter loved them ❤️❤️She couldn’t believe someone would putHer puppy on socks
PupSocks,2020-12-25T18:17:03Z,1,I ordered my pup socks in October for a christmas gift and today is christmas day and I never received my socks. Canceled my order to get a refund and only got half of it back
PupSocks,2020-12-25T18:14:48Z,5,"Love them, super cute, good quality! Great for a gift!"
PupSocks,2020-12-25T18:13:37Z,2,Still have not received an update on where my order is. And did not receive on time for christmas :(
PupSocks,2020-12-25T18:11:14Z,5,"Bought a blanket with our cats faces for my fiancé for Xmas. I was surprised at the high quality of the blanket, not to mention it came out great and and it was her favorite gift. Definitely worth every penny."
PupSocks,2020-12-25T18:05:43Z,5,I bought 4 pairs of these and all the people we gifted them to absolute love them!!! The perfect gift for pretty much everyone you love!
PupSocks,2020-12-25T18:04:27Z,1,"I ordered 2 of the exact same items on the same day (Black Friday). One shipped and received it 2 weeks later. I never did receive the second one. After 4 days of waiting for a response, they told me that it was still in production. After almost 5 weeks of ordering it and 2 1/2 weeks after the first one arrived, I finally get a shipping notification that it shipped and wouldn’t be here until 3 days AFTER Christmas. These were Christmas gifts for my children. I felt like I ordered in enough time to get them finished and shipped well before Christmas. And I don’t think it had anything to do with the postal service either. I think someone forgot to print the second one and they didn’t start it until after I sent a couple different messages. Poor customer service. And I was really looking forward to giving these fun gifts to my kids for Christmas, AT THW SAME TIME. I will it order from them again."
PupSocks,2020-12-25T18:03:28Z,1,"I understand that the times are crazy, but it took almost a month for my order to get to me. I raised the issue with customer service and they chose to ignore my complaint and sent me a generic response email, not even remotely trying to apologize. The product was for a birthday, they arrived late. No acknowledgement of this, the quality was shotty, highly recommend that you avoid. Completely dissatisfied. Enjoy my money. Heartless and gutleas"
PupSocks,2020-12-25T18:02:10Z,5,Although it took a little longer to receive my order I did in fact receive in time to gift!  We absolutely loved our socks with our puppy “rocky” printed on them!  They were the hit of the party and everyone young and old enjoyed them and got such a kick out of them ! Worth every Penney. We will be ordering again!!!!!
PupSocks,2020-12-25T18:00:55Z,1,Got a completely wrong order someone else’s dog on my socks . Emailed for two weeks straight no inquiries on why my order was messed up nothing .
PupSocks,2020-12-25T18:00:49Z,5,"Great product, picture quality is great on the socks.  Will order again"
PupSocks,2020-12-25T17:59:39Z,1,It has been a month and I still do nit have my $30 socks.  That is ridiculous!  Emailed the company...no response.  I understand stress in delivery services during the holidays but I ordered them in November and still nothing.
PupSocks,2020-12-25T17:58:46Z,1,"I ordered socks early November for Christmas presents,.. well it’s now Christmas Day and no socks! Terrible, will never order again."
PupSocks,2020-12-25T17:57:41Z,5,Delivered on time.  Exceeded expectations.
PupSocks,2020-12-25T17:57:07Z,1,"It has been a month since the socks were ordered and I havent received them.  Unfortunately, they missed Christmas morning."
PupSocks,2020-12-25T17:55:36Z,5,I gifted them to my brother who's dog just passed and he LOVED them!
PupSocks,2020-12-25T17:54:24Z,2,I still have not received my order....placed order a month ago....did not receive before Christmas :(
PupSocks,2020-12-25T17:52:42Z,5,Absolutely fantastic work!! My husband was in awe of how great the banket and socks came out. Would definitely buy from them again.
PupSocks,2020-12-25T17:50:26Z,5,My sister loved her socks!
PupSocks,2020-12-25T17:47:49Z,1,I ordered in plenty of time to give as a Christmas present and still waiting on them. Disappointing.
PupSocks,2020-12-25T17:47:31Z,1,"I loved the idea of these socks and I ordered 10 pairs them for all my nieces and nephews and my sister in law, with their pets on them.When they arrived they were awful. I did not send them to any of my family members.  They were poor fitting, super wide and loose at the toes, and tube-like, so they bunched at the ankles. As well some of the images were OK and some were blurry, nothing like the mock up they sent me. The youth sizes were as big as the adult size so even more ill fitting. As well I ordered them in the middle of November and they came in the middle of January… So needless to say they missed Christmas. Very disappointed."
PupSocks,2020-12-25T17:44:38Z,1,Ordered twice. 1st time had a problem pre-shipment. Figured I would give them a second chance. That was a mistake.
PupSocks,2020-12-25T17:42:33Z,1,I cant track my order and haven’t received it yet after a month
PupSocks,2020-12-25T17:42:03Z,1,"I’m sad to give one star, especially on Christmas Day, but my order was a disaster. I ordered two blankets, one arrived here instead of in Texas with my son. And, the second arrived late and has a picture of someone else’s child. Lol!! I feel bad for whoever got our blanket, because it’s my son pulling a really weird face. My attempts to reunite this child with his blanket have failed, because I can’t get hold of you guys. I get the same long copy and paste email each time. Postage is messed up, I get it. If you’re overwhelmed with orders, stop advertising. If you can’t get the orders correct for your present customers, stop advertising for more. My attempt to do something funny for my son failed, but it’s just a blanket, and not the end of the world. I’m just unlikely to order from you again.Update: we’ve decided to call the little boy on our blanket, Johnathon. He’s an interesting addition to our family. Pupsocks did reach out via email, but 4 days later no reply to my response."
PupSocks,2020-12-25T17:40:48Z,1,"Order was placed back in November. Received notification that is was shipping in a couple days, everything was good. It is now Christmas Day and I am yet to receive my item. When trying to reach customer service only option is to send an email. Never received a response from first email sent. After second email sent finally received response that the package can now be considered lost after two weeks. They replaced the order but the second package is also missing and who knows if I will ever receive my item. I was really excited to order these as they look really great. But after this experience I would say I will most likely never use them again."
PupSocks,2020-12-25T17:40:13Z,5,These made the perfect Christmas gift!
PupSocks,2020-12-25T17:39:13Z,5,Great product and was delivered in a timely manner. They did a great job with the picture of our cat on the blanket.
PupSocks,2020-12-25T17:38:25Z,5,"The quality,  in terms of the clarity of the pictures (I used 3) was perfect. Having the ability to choose different themes is also very notable. I have a 2nd order on the way and I gave you more business based on the quality of the 1st order."
PupSocks,2020-12-25T17:38:10Z,3,Neat idea! The sock quality I am not as impressed with as I thought I would be for the price. Nice gimmick gift idea.
PupSocks,2020-12-25T17:37:31Z,1,Damaged. Sent email directly after receiving and got no response. Ordered them well in advance for Christmas and had to get a new gift.
PupSocks,2020-12-25T17:37:26Z,2,I ordered on November 26th and the website said I’d have my order in 8-10 business days. It’s December 25th and I still don’t have it. I emailed the company twice and finally heard back. They said they’d refund me 25% of my money. I haven’t gotten that back either. Fingers crossed that I get my order and that it’s correct. I like to support small businesses but this was a little frustrating.
PupSocks,2020-12-25T17:35:03Z,5,"The socks were a huge hit for my daughter.  These were made to perfection, and shipped quickly.  The perfect Christmas gift!"
PupSocks,2020-12-25T17:33:54Z,2,The socks were good quality but order was some else’s dog and wrong color socks!
PupSocks,2020-12-25T17:33:35Z,5,I bought pup socks as a Christmas gift for my wife and she loved them.  The quality of picture and the fabric of the sock were awesome and she was thrilled!
PupSocks,2020-12-25T17:32:58Z,1,"I was told delivery by Christmas; however, they did not meet that statement! I ordered three weeks prior to Christmas and the first socks they sent out got stuck in shipping and was told they’d send another pair. They did not send the second pair until a week before Christmas which meant they I did not receive my purchase for Christmas!! Highly disappointed!!!"
PupSocks,2020-12-25T17:32:51Z,5,This was a gift for my mom and she absolutely loved it so much it brought tears to her eyes to have her grandbabies on a blanket!!
PupSocks,2020-12-25T17:31:27Z,5,"My son-in-law loves my little dog, Mikey, BUT stationed in Japan, he never gets to see him. So, I had Mikey's face put on socks and sent over for Christmas! It was the best gift he got! Now he can ""take Mikey to work""  :)"
PupSocks,2020-12-25T17:30:36Z,5,I bought a blanket with a picture of our dog on it for my wife for Christmas. She absolutely loved it get quality and they managed to get it to us in time for Christmas!
PupSocks,2020-12-25T17:30:35Z,5,The masks were everything I expected. I will be ordering more merchandise.
PupSocks,2020-12-25T17:30:16Z,5,bought them as a surprise for my wife - she loves them. Photo on them came out even better than I expected.
PupSocks,2020-12-25T17:29:42Z,5,The blanket is much more plush than what I was expecting and thats a good thing.  So cute!
PupSocks,2020-12-25T17:28:51Z,5,"Mom loved them! She said, “that looks like our Murph!”  I said “that’s because it is!”   She was very excited."
PupSocks,2020-12-25T17:28:02Z,5,"My daughter loves blankets and there is nothing better than having her fury friend on her blanket! Thank you for your creative ideas! This blanket is warm, and soft and cozy!"
PupSocks,2020-12-25T17:22:49Z,2,"The pictures came out well, but the actual socks they are printed on are REALLY crappy. They are made of a sort of gross unidentifiable synthetic fabric that has an odd slippery feel to it. They are also totally shapeless socks that are equally wide at the foot, the ankle and the top where they meet your calf. They are essentially tube socks, but they are so wide that unless you have major cankles, they would never stay pulled up. Great work getting my cats picture on there, but I don’t think you could have possibly chosen worse socks to print the pictures on."
PupSocks,2020-12-25T17:22:44Z,1,I selected different poses but got all the same pose on all the socks. Waste of money and my time sizing pics.
PupSocks,2020-12-25T17:20:25Z,5,I couldn't stop smiling and laughing when I received my order to gift for my husband for Christmas. It was perfect! We got the green large blanket with our golden retriever's face. I adore it!
PupSocks,2020-12-25T17:17:59Z,1,Never received
PupSocks,2020-12-25T17:17:53Z,5,Great turn around time and they were able to crop the pictures perfectly.
PupSocks,2020-12-25T17:17:32Z,5,Great gift for my kids- they loved the pic of our pup on their socks.
PupSocks,2020-12-25T17:16:18Z,5,My husband loved loved loved the quality and our Princesses pic on the socks.
PupSocks,2020-12-25T17:16:08Z,5,They are simply adorable!
PupSocks,2020-12-25T17:15:37Z,5,I bought these for my 17 and 20yr old kids and they LOVED them!!!  Pics came out great on the socks.
PupSocks,2020-12-25T17:14:49Z,1,"It took 3 weeks to receive the socks, and they had the wrong animal on them. Was supposed to be two dogs, but the image on the socks was a cat! I emailed customer support 5 days ago, still have not heard a response."
PupSocks,2020-12-25T17:14:30Z,1,I never received my order.
PupSocks,2020-12-25T17:13:39Z,1,I ordered socks Nov 15th and they still are not delivered.    They refuse to call after several attempts to reach out to make the situation right.   They have been   terrible to work with and it ruined my present to my parents.   I will advise anyone to think again before placing an order.
PupSocks,2020-12-25T17:13:23Z,1,Directions for picture cropping were ignored. Socks are way too expensive for a non-custom product
PupSocks,2020-12-25T17:12:49Z,5,Better than expected. My adult Kids loved their pairs!! Thank you.
PupSocks,2020-12-25T17:11:29Z,2,"Received only two of the three pairs I ordered. The third pair had someone else’s dog. Mistakes happen and that I understand, however customer service is not helpful and I still don’t know if they are correcting the problem."
PupSocks,2020-12-25T17:10:44Z,5,Loved them and good quality also!
PupSocks,2020-12-25T17:10:16Z,5,"Easy ordering, fast delivery and my family loved them on Christmas Day."
PupSocks,2020-12-25T17:09:56Z,1,"Sent an email to review PupSocks.  1 star an easy choice.  How can you review something that is weeks late based on the advertised delivery date at time of purchase, and still yet more weeks away from arriving based on the tracking progress.  If it’s going to take close to 6 or 7 weeks to arrive just say so.  Really disappointed."
PupSocks,2020-12-25T17:09:50Z,1,Had two dogs. One pair out of four showed up with just one dogs face. The other three had both. Thought I ordered a 5th pair and had two tracking numbers so thought it was coming and didn’t. Not sure what went wrong there. Not a pleasant pair of socks to actually wear.
PupSocks,2020-12-25T17:09:42Z,4,"Great printing, sock quality was less than expected"
PupSocks,2020-12-25T17:09:09Z,1,"The socks looked very cool. They arrived on time. Everybody loved them (They were gifts to the family members.) Everybody wanted to put them on right away. However, the huge disappointment was that they were super uncomfortable to wear, and everybody took them off."
PupSocks,2020-12-25T17:09:03Z,3,"Socks... Everyone buys them at some point. So, we all know what you can get for your money, right? While PupSocks has a great concept behind it and are a great gift idea, let's not be fools here. For the price I paid for 2 pairs of socks from this Facebook-ads-driven company, I could have bought socks that would be 10 times the quality and would last a lifetime. These, while looking good, might just be great to pin on your wall."
PupSocks,2020-12-25T17:08:52Z,1,Ordered in November and haven’t received them yet.
PupSocks,2020-12-25T17:08:37Z,5,Great socks!!!!!
PupSocks,2020-12-25T17:06:55Z,2,"Socks still have not arrived, they are extremely late. For the price you pay, I was hoping for better service."
PupSocks,2020-12-25T17:04:48Z,5,I bought these socks for my 26 yr old niece for Christmas.  She loves her Frenchie and  English bulldogs.   She LOVED the socks.  She was so excited to see her babies faces.   The socks were great quality and hearing my niece this morning tell me how much she loved them was priceless.   They arrived within 5 days of ordering them.  Highly recommend pupsocks!
PupSocks,2020-12-25T17:04:32Z,5,Exactly as I expected and such great quality
PupSocks,2020-12-25T17:03:53Z,1,"I ordered a pair of socks as a Christmas gift. After 3 weeks and no shipment, I reached out to customer service 3 times with no response. I cancelled my order only to realize I couldn’t even receive a full refund which was BS. Their excuse was that their artists had already worked on my order which was also BS because it had been 3 weeks!! Website processing time said 4 days. I filed a dispute with PayPal to get my full refund and only then did I hear from this company. It is a SCAM and I am not the only customer with this experience. Check out Pupsocks or Pupscam on Facebook. The better business bureau needs to check this business out and shut them down. It is sad that they affiliate themselves with the Humane Society because they are such a horrible business."
PupSocks,2020-12-25T17:03:47Z,5,"This was surprisingly better than I thought. The order shipped fast, with communication emails during the process. The final product turned out much better than I expected as well. Glad I made the purchase."
PupSocks,2020-12-25T17:03:44Z,4,"The blanket is really soft and cute, but the design cut out was not the best. The socks are a wierd fabric but haven't tried them on yet. Overall I'm satisfied."
PupSocks,2020-12-25T16:59:38Z,1,Poor service; poor communication and poor quality products
PupSocks,2020-12-25T16:59:16Z,5,Awesome use of downloaded picture of our dog. Gift recipient is very pleased.
PupSocks,2020-12-25T16:58:46Z,5,These were so high quality. Socks were soft and the quality of the pictures on them were better than I expected.
PupSocks,2020-12-25T16:58:08Z,5,"I bought two pair, one for each daughter for Christmas. By far, their favorite gift!  A huge hit. Highly recommend!!"
PupSocks,2020-12-25T16:57:57Z,3,"The socks are very cute. But...Fit is weird. Very wide foot— the look rectangular. No tapering from narrow heel to toes. My nine year old refuses to wear them since they are so baggy from heel to mid foot. Purchased XS for size three youth foot. The top band—does not resemble any modern sock. Reminds me of the bands my grandpa wore around his socks to hold them up, only on the inside. Very cute in the package. Sadly, will never be worn. Clever idea—but I don’t blame him for not wearing them."
PupSocks,2020-12-25T16:57:02Z,1,"My pet’s picture is on the socks, but the socks are of low quality and poor styling.  They were a gift for my daughter.  I know she’ll never wear them because they aren’t soft, they’re not stylish.  They’re like knee socks.  Cheap looking. Not at all what I saw pictured on the website when I placed my order.  Too bad, because they were overpriced, too.   Really disappointed."
PupSocks,2020-12-25T16:54:11Z,1,I ordered nov 27th and have still not received my ordered. I emailed multiple times with no response.   All you guys did was print a label but never shipped my item. Worst company ever.
PupSocks,2020-12-25T16:52:53Z,5,My daughters Love their pup socks!! They can have their pup with them at all times.
PupSocks,2020-12-25T16:52:45Z,1,Haven’t received the item yet and no one is responding via email.
PupSocks,2020-12-25T16:52:31Z,5,Got a pair of these socks for my wife for Christmas. They loaded 2 pics of my dogs on them. The socks showed up quickly and they were perfect.  The pictures look great!  My wife absolutely loves them!!
PupSocks,2020-12-25T16:52:25Z,2,These are very cute.  The printing is very well done and we love seeing our dog on socks. Unfortunately the material is scratchy and too uncomfortable to wear.  These would be perfect with softer material.
PupSocks,2020-12-25T16:52:21Z,1,"1 month later, still don’t have my order."
PupSocks,2020-12-25T16:52:12Z,2,"I was sent the wrong order(someone else’s) and have been trying to get in contact with this company , no one has responded to any of my messages."
PupSocks,2020-12-25T16:52:08Z,4,"Blanket is so cute....Wished reverse side was a coordinating color instead of white.   Otherwise, great experience"
PupSocks,2020-12-25T16:51:19Z,1,"I ordered my socks on Black Friday, still awaiting delivery, one month later.  Maybe the socks are good, but I don't know yet.  But this review is based on a solicitation from Pupsocks to me via email."
PupSocks,2020-12-25T16:50:14Z,2,"The quality of the socks is great, the picture quality of our puppy on the socks is great. I ordered a women's small (size 4-8) for my wife who is a size 7. The small is about 3+ sizes too large. If the size actually fits you, the shape of the flat tube sock won't make your foot feel comfortable. Overall, they're a fun conversation starter but not something you'll want to wear a lot."
PupSocks,2020-12-25T16:50:00Z,3,Took forever to receive
PupSocks,2020-12-25T16:49:55Z,5,Love it great quality blanket and so soft!
PupSocks,2020-12-25T16:49:08Z,4,This was a gift for my niece for Christmas. The socks themselves are a polyester/nylon blend (not cotton) so they looked cheap to me. The concept is cool and the picture turned out great on the sock.  I was not happy with quality of sock for the cost.
PupSocks,2020-12-25T16:48:35Z,3,Took over a month to arrive. A little pricey but good quality overall
PupSocks,2020-12-25T16:48:20Z,5,Love how the blanket turned out. The faces of both cats are clear and it’s going to make an amazing gift. The blanket is soft and snuggly.
PupSocks,2020-12-25T16:47:14Z,1,Haven’t gotten it yet and ordered it yet on November 20 in hopes of getting it before christmas
PupSocks,2020-12-25T16:47:12Z,5,Absolutely perfectly adorable!!!
PupSocks,2020-12-25T16:46:14Z,5,"The socks turned out great! Images were sharp and even though the size of the photos submitted were not even, you guys made them the same size. My friend was so surprised. Thanks for the great job, communication, and fast delivery."
PupSocks,2020-12-25T16:46:13Z,5,Fabulous and one of a kind gifts. ❤️
PupSocks,2020-12-25T16:46:05Z,2,"I saw the ad for Pup Socks on Black Friday and thought they would make cute gifts. I ordered 2 socks and 1 blanket right then and there, but, I can't technically say what the product is like because I haven't received them yet. I ordered with the assurance that I'd receive the products before Christmas.  The products won't arrive until after Christmas. To make up for it,  the company emailed me some lame mock ups to print out for family members which I'm not going to bother with.   This is why I normally shop Amazon. I didn't need the product in two days, but I had at least thought I'd receive the products the week before Christmas so I could ship them out.  I wouldn't recommend using this company for time sensitive gifts. If you can wait a month or more for your product, then maybe give them a try."
PupSocks,2020-12-25T16:44:48Z,3,"I ordered socks for my son with the pictures of both our cats. One recently passed away and it hit him pretty hard. I thought ordering socks with their faces on it would cheer him up. The socks themselves were great. The pictures looked really well and they were his favorite color, green. However, I ordered the kid size and they don't fit properly. The top by the toes are wide with extra space, but near the heel/ankle it becomes really tight and bunches up. He will still keep them, but its unfortunate that they don't fit good."
PupSocks,2020-12-25T16:44:36Z,5,"The socks were beautifully made, and the pictures of my parents’ dogs turned out very clearly! They were thrilled with their gifts. And they arrived in the nick of time too!"
PupSocks,2020-12-25T16:41:08Z,1,Order never came. Asked for assistance and the email bounced back.
PupSocks,2020-12-25T16:40:45Z,5,These socks are SO cute and great quality! Can’t wait to order more!
PupSocks,2020-12-25T16:40:41Z,3,Color was totally not what I sent the picture of. I have a gray cat and on the blanket he is brown.
PupSocks,2020-12-25T16:38:22Z,5,I purchased these as a small gift and was very pleased with how they turned out. Good quality and they cropped the picture perfectly. Shipping was prompt as well. Will definitely order again should the need for another pair of personalized animal socks arise.
PupSocks,2020-12-25T16:36:41Z,5,"Great socks, timely shipping. Very satisfied indeed! The socks are definitely a hit-"
PupSocks,2020-12-25T16:35:39Z,5,Socks are cute. Very unique. They arrived on time.
PupSocks,2020-12-25T16:34:53Z,1,I ordered my socks on November 19th and I didn't receive them for Christmas. Very poor job.
PupSocks,2020-12-25T16:33:35Z,1,"I ordered my socks in mid November and they did not arrive in time for Christmas. It was very disappointing. I was also unable to track my order, so I still have no idea where they are or when they’ll arrive."
PupSocks,2020-12-25T16:33:15Z,1,"I know this is an automated email and I already got the mass email from the company saying cause of the pandemic there’s massive delays with shipping. I’m sure it’s a logistically nightmare. However I wanted my order to give for a Christmas present. It was shipped almost 3 weeks ago within the United States and it hasn’t even moved in transit yet when I tracked it. To make it worse I sent an email to support to find out if there is any update they can give me, got a generated response saying they’ll get back to me and never did. So since I haven’t gotten the merchandise yet my review so far is how this whole thing has been handled and I’m sorry to say not very well. I’ve gotten parcels delivered from China within the same time as waiting for this order to come. I live in NY not the backwoods of some off the grid compound in the mid west. If you can’t deliver something pandemic or not in a month from Georgia to NY then someone is doing something wrong. Plus the audacity to send an email on Christmas asking how we did when I didn’t even get my delivery yet and it was supposed to be a gift given today on Christmas. Sorry for being a little salty but until you prove otherwise. This is unacceptable"
PupSocks,2020-12-25T16:33:15Z,5,Came out better than expected and I can't wait for my significant other to open this gift!!
PupSocks,2020-12-25T16:30:03Z,1,"Product has never turned up after 6 weeks... this is an absolute con! DO NOT GIVE ANY MONEY to these people. They can passed me off to a delivery company, who told me to contact them, then nothing!"
PupSocks,2020-12-25T16:29:22Z,1,"Have not received 2 orders that were made on November 26. Today is Christmas Day! No gift! I got one email reply to my question as to where my order was and an offer of a 25% refund. Guess what? No refund either! Blaming the USPS only goes so far. Switch shipping carriers! I do not recommend this company, move on and find someone else. Very poor customer service"
PupSocks,2020-12-25T16:27:42Z,5,In memory of our recently lost cat  my wife just loved them for Christmas.
PupSocks,2020-12-25T16:26:58Z,1,Horrible experience. The company messed up my order and has made it very tough to get this fixed. Mostly because they just don’t respond. Mistakes happen and I am okay with that. Ignoring the problem for weeks is not ok. Terrible customer service. There are lots of competitors out there. I suggest trying someone else.
PupSocks,2020-12-25T16:26:11Z,5,This was a gift for my wife and she loved it
PupSocks,2020-12-25T16:26:06Z,1,"Customer service was terrible. As someone who works in customer service, I am absolutely appalled with the experience I had and I would be fired if I gave such mediocre and lackluster assistance."
PupSocks,2020-12-25T16:24:59Z,1,Only sent one of two pairs ordered.  Sent numerous emails and finally got a response.  Eventually shipped the missing pair bu t no t received yet on xmas day🤨.  Did appreciate the card showing gift had been ordered.
PupSocks,2020-12-25T16:21:38Z,5,Ordered a cat blanket with two pictures for my niece.   It turned out fabulous.  Would order from here again!
PupSocks,2020-12-25T16:21:26Z,5,So happy with what I ordered. I ordered for several family members with their pets printed on socks and blankets. Everyone was so happy with their gifts. Made me feel good to see everyone so excited.  Beautiful well made!!!
PupSocks,2020-12-25T16:19:09Z,1,"Not happy at all. The material is not comfy, size doesn’t fit, and our cats faces are on a dog sock. Poor quality all around and a waste of money."
PupSocks,2020-12-25T16:16:16Z,1,"I haven't received them yet. I placed my order on November 27 and paid the international shipping. They were supposed to be part of the gifts for my nephew and sister for Christmas. For how expensive these socks are,  the novelty has worn off and my excitement has dwindled away. Not worth the price, especially if they dont arrive within a month.  very disappointed!"
PupSocks,2020-12-25T16:15:41Z,1,"My order was not complete, took weeks to ship it, and haven’t heard back from the company"
PupSocks,2020-12-25T16:14:35Z,5,"Ordered for Christmas Santa gifts for my 2 daughters.  They absolutely loved them.  One even started crying. She said it was her favorite gift.  Wonderful product, great quality, fast shipping, and highly recommend."
PupSocks,2020-12-25T16:14:20Z,5,"I would just like to say how much I LOVED the socks I ordered. They were a present for my husband and I’m surprised I was able to wait until Christmas Day to give them to him. They made me laugh so hard (in a fantastic way) so see my dogs simple face on socks. So worth it, and I will be buying more and have told several people how awesome these are. THANK YOU!!!!"
PupSocks,2020-12-25T16:12:42Z,5,Great gift idea for pet owners! Great quality and images of pet are perfect.
PupSocks,2020-12-25T16:11:40Z,5,Great socks!!!
PupSocks,2020-12-25T16:11:06Z,2,"The socks look okay, but the material is awful. I would not recommend these. It’s not worth the cost."
PupSocks,2020-12-25T16:10:44Z,2,Gift didn’t arrive in time for Christmas
PupSocks,2020-12-25T16:10:36Z,1,"I ordered a pair of socks -- but received a completely different pair. I reached out numerous times to Customer service, and though I was told that I would hear back within 24 hours, I heard nothing. I finally went to the Better Business Bureau, and they reached out on my behalf. My issue was resolved then -- a full refund. But I wouldn't order from here again."
PupSocks,2020-12-25T15:57:33Z,5,Love them but they never asked what size. Way too large for a female
PupSocks,2020-12-25T15:56:26Z,1,"I made my order on November 27. Checked order status about 10 days later and my order number showed that it didn't exist. Emailed customer service, no reply for 4 days. Then they sent a tracking number from an in house generated mailing slip. They blamed the post office but they actually have to mail it for the tracking number to work. It is now christmas day and still no order. It was for a present so don't waste your time and money on this company"
PupSocks,2020-12-25T15:43:56Z,1,"I placed my order in November knowing full well that it would be up to 10 business days for delivery.  I feel I ordered in plenty of time for a Christmas arrival, yet have jot received my order.  I did however receive an email with a photo attachment of what my product will look like.  So, people are being paid to answer and send emails, yet not work on the products that have been ordered??!!! I understand all the expected delays due to Covid, however my order was placed 6 weeks early!!! I will NOT be ordering from you again, and I will make sure my friends and family know to find another company to order from.  I think a refund is appropriate considering the cost as well as time!! An email with a photo is not an acceptable replacement!!!"
PupSocks,2020-12-25T15:42:26Z,5,I was very impressed with both the turnaround time and the quality of the photo reproduction. They captured the pets perfectly!
PupSocks,2020-12-25T15:42:15Z,5,My daughter loved them
PupSocks,2020-12-25T15:41:14Z,5,"Product is great, got the socks and large blanket. My wife loved it. Had some shipping issues but don’t think it was the fault of anyone except the carrier but even then it’s the holidays and Covid. So I’ll definitely be back."
PupSocks,2020-12-25T15:36:14Z,1,"Took my money two months ago and never received my product. Even with Covid to consider, this was too much. Form emails in response to my inquiries. So sad about spreading negativity online, but this what happened."
PupSocks,2020-12-25T15:34:56Z,1,Ordet never came
PupSocks,2020-12-25T15:27:07Z,5,Came fast and look great! Also looks like good quality
PupSocks,2020-12-25T15:26:53Z,1,When my mask finally arrived there were two dogs on their. One was mine the other was a dog I’ve never seen in my life. After all the hassle of getting it and making sure it arrives before Christmas I just threw it straight into the trash. I’ll never be ordering from you again
PupSocks,2020-12-25T15:22:04Z,5,Gave as a Christmas gift...my daughter absolutely loved!
PupSocks,2020-12-25T15:18:00Z,2,"I submitted my order over a month ago and I’m still waiting for my pup socks to arrive. I ordered them early so I could give to my daughter on Christmas and it’s Christmas Day and still no pup socks so I’m very disappointed. Tracking says still in transit, so If they ever arrive I’ll give them to her for her birthday next month."
PupSocks,2020-12-25T15:14:44Z,5,Came out better than expected!
PupSocks,2020-12-25T15:11:42Z,1,"I ordered with plenty of time to be received by now.  I got an email update on 22 December saying that they were ""shipped"".  Still remained hopeful.  However, when checking the tracking, it only indicated that a shipping label had been created but the items were not even at the post office yet.  Very disappointed."
PupSocks,2020-12-25T15:07:39Z,3,"Cute socks. Love that service is in your mission.  The socks took a very long time to arrive, and the socks themselves were thinner and of a cheaper quality than I'd expected. I'd prefer socks not made in China (even if they're printed in Atlanta). But I do like the mission of the company."
PupSocks,2020-12-25T14:55:46Z,5,"This was a great gift to my husband who has everything! He was so surprised and thought it was a great gift. I am not sure how often he will wear them, but there were definitely some laughs when opening the package!"
PupSocks,2020-12-25T14:44:14Z,1,very disappointing service. I placed my order November 27th and today is Christmas day and I do not have it to give to my child for a Christmas gift I did the tracking and it's not supposed to be delivered till December 28th. Will never order from your company again and will also tell anybody I speak to not to order very poor service into getting it out for the holiday
PupSocks,2020-12-25T14:44:13Z,1,"I still have not received my socks.   Ordered them over a month and a half ago.There is no direct number that you can call to talk to anyone, I’ve emailed several times and get back a generic email that they are “working on them”. Would like to just have a refund but cannot talk to anyone in person to try to facilitate that."
PupSocks,2020-12-25T14:42:24Z,5,"Even though I still have not received my order after a month, this review is for how well the company has communicated with me about my order. I haven’t had to reach out to them at all, I’ve been updated often. The problem was with the carrier, not them, and they even went ahead to have another item made, which is why it’s not here yet. I appreciate a company that communicates well."
PupSocks,2020-12-25T14:42:00Z,2,I can't really provide a review. I live in Canada and ordered the socks for my family on Nov 27. Still haven't received the socks yet and tracking shows them being processed in Florida still. And I paid for shipping. I received two updates by email. One from my inquiry and one an automatic reply recognizing covid related delays. I would love to give more stars. But I can't right now.
PupSocks,2020-12-25T14:40:44Z,5,I love them! I cannot WAIT to give them to my brother for Christmas!!
PupSocks,2020-12-25T14:34:03Z,1,"Poor image quality, need to return."
PupSocks,2020-12-25T14:30:12Z,1,"I ordered several items totaling more than $250 a month in advance of when I wanted them. I received only a very small amount of the purchased items before the date I needed them. Some of my orders said they were shipped and several weeks later still have not arrived and others still say in production when I track my order threw the website. Trying to get a hold of someone at this company is 100% impossible, when I tried contacting them all I would get is a generic email from the supposed CEO explaining how busy they were and blaming the USPS and COVID  for slow delivery times(even though their own website shows my month old order still in production). If I had not made promises to my children for these products I would cancel all my orders and never order from them again. As it stands who knows when my products will show up or even if they ever will. I surely will never order anything from this company ever again and I will advice friends, family and others not to also."
PupSocks,2020-12-25T14:30:08Z,1,"I ordered $130 worth of custom face masks back on November 27th, thinking that would be plenty of time to have them in time for Christmas. Boy, was I wrong. It’s Christmas and they didn’t arrive in time. The worst part was I received no updates or apology messages until I had inquired to customer service regarding the status of my order. Save your time and $. Do not order from this company."
PupSocks,2020-12-25T14:29:37Z,2,"Very disappointed that I did not get my order before Christmas.  I ordered on November 19... It may not be your fault as we depend on the postal services but maybe you could inform us on your site of the possible delivery times depending on the destination (maybe you did and I just don’t remember). I did see the final product (socks) in the last e-mail you sent me, and I was very pleased. Crossing my fingers to get my socks soon so I can offer them for New Years’!Thank you"
PupSocks,2020-12-25T14:25:18Z,1,"I ordered two cat socks and uploaded my cats pictures. I got two socks that have a picture of a dog on them. I didn’t get what I ordered, not even close. I had high hopes and was really excited when I ordered them."
PupSocks,2020-12-25T13:52:08Z,4,Ordered a month ago - didn’t show up for Christmas
PupSocks,2020-12-25T13:28:41Z,1,"I don’t have my order and it’s been 29 days since I’ve ordered it, still nothing. Just put the socks in an envelope with a couple stamps and it should arrive in no less than 5 days. Also very little communication on order status."
PupSocks,2020-12-25T13:14:57Z,2,"We received someone else’s socks and when I went to the web page to call customer service to check on my order, there is no phone number. I sent an email asking for status of my order (with order #) and no response. This was a Christmas present for my daughter after her dog died this summer and have no idea if I will be even getting the socks I ordered and paid for or not. Was very excited when I made the order now I’m just flat disappointed and have to explain this to my daughter today. Just in case order # is 2427046. Any help is appreciated."
PupSocks,2020-12-25T13:13:31Z,1,first pair defective waiting for 2nd pair to be shipped with no response. did received a fake email from the CEO (doubt it) that packages where being delayed due to covid...... my remake of the defective socks have not even been shipped.... Will NEVER   and I mean NEVER purchase nor recommend using this company again for anything....I was sucked in paying $35 for a pair of socks and $80 for a blanket both I could have purchased at Walmart for $20.
PupSocks,2020-12-25T12:56:17Z,2,"Waste of money. I give 2 stars because the communication and the image were ok. The quality of the socks is terrible, and the shape of it doesn't make sens. It's flat socks, good for printing but bad shape to wear. The heel is narrow and the toes are too wide. It's a gift that make you giggle until you put it on before it ends at the back of a drawer. Save your money"
PupSocks,2020-12-25T12:43:21Z,5,Sox’s are fabulous. Image is clear and crisp. I cannot wait for my daughter to open this gift. Thank you for such a unique opportunity to give her this to her.
PupSocks,2020-12-25T12:43:08Z,1,The socks are poor quality and very odd looking.  The size was way too big for the person I bought them for.  They ended up fitting a size 12 male instead of a size 8 female.  I was very disappointed overall with this whole experience.
PupSocks,2020-12-25T12:42:35Z,1,"Ordered 12/5 didn’t ship for Xmas, no response except we’re overwhelmed."
PupSocks,2020-12-25T11:50:09Z,1,I’d love to review my items/order but it has been a month since I placed my order and I have yet to receive my items. There was no indication at time of purchase that I would need to spend the extra money on faster shipping to get my product in time for Christmas. I now spent $92 on 3 Christmas presents that I don’t have for Christmas. Instead I get a email with pictures of my order (to I guess show my family their presents I don’t physically have?)) and 40% off my next order. Problem is ... there won’t be a next order.
PupSocks,2020-12-25T11:46:31Z,1,i ordered 2 months ago and it took a month and a half before you even shipped the product and it still hasn't arrived. Im very disappointed with the service
PupSocks,2020-12-25T11:37:08Z,5,"The color & picture is excellent.  Quality of the sock is great.  A bit pricey, but as they are a gift and commemorate a special dog who has passed I can justify it."
PupSocks,2020-12-25T11:20:28Z,1,Felt like compression stockings. No place for heel no extra fabric for top of foot like sock form should have. Cute graphic xfer but not wearable.
PupSocks,2020-12-25T10:12:05Z,1,"First it was delivered veeery late ... of course due to Covid and so on, but not a single message to warn me as a customer waiting to receive my order for a gift. When arrived, quite disappointed of the quality and the size, really not adapted to my girlfriend feet. Too bad. No more order for me."
PupSocks,2020-12-25T09:42:27Z,1,"Never received the socks, so hard to rate how good they were!"
PupSocks,2020-12-25T09:41:11Z,4,I am very satisfied with the final product. The fabric is comfortable and it looks good too. Nothing was damaged and the gift box looks attractive.My criticism is that the product took a long time (1.5 months) to arrive. This would not be a problem if I could prepare for it but on the site it said that the delivery time would go about 10-12 days. The company should change this time on the website or write a mail to the customer that it will take longer than expectet (was not the case with me).
PupSocks,2020-12-25T09:08:58Z,1,"I ordered November 15 leaving enough time for Xmas and here I am Xmas morning without the special fun present. Then I get this email Nov 28 ""I am more than willing to refund 15% of your order for the delay and have your order sent out within 3-5 business days.""So I accepted the 15% off as I knew the order would be sent out quickly, so I thought. Actually December 14 I get a notice of shipment but according to the tracking ""Saturday, December 19, 2020 2:50 PMMIAMI FL 33152 US Shipment Received, Package Acceptance Pending"" and again ""Monday, December 21, 2020 6:20 PMMIAMI FL 33126 US Departed"" Rule #1 if you can't deliver a product accordingly, then don't sell it. This same post will go on Facebook where I first saw the ad for your product."
PupSocks,2020-12-25T08:38:32Z,1,Still waiting .....
PupSocks,2020-12-25T08:35:29Z,5,It's so soft and the pictures look amazing! I'm so happy with my blanket!
PupSocks,2020-12-25T08:25:57Z,5,So good our kids got the socks from Santa they loved them!
PupSocks,2020-12-25T08:19:50Z,1,"NEVER BUY FROM THIS COMPANY! It’s a complete scam. They trade under a multitude of names, pretend they are in the USA when they’re in China, send fake shipment details through a pretend shipping company that doesn’t exist, then blame the shipping company that you haven’t had your order for 7wks. IF you do receive anything, you’re guaranteed it’s not your order and the quality is terrible (according to those I’ve seen). You know it’s bad when there’s even a Facebook group foiling them as scammers with hundreds of others in the same boat."
PupSocks,2020-12-25T07:21:25Z,3,I can’t say how it is....I ordered in November and still have not received my order yet. I’m sure it will be lovely. Sad it didn’t make it here for Xmas. Every time I look it’s still in Miami. 😔
PupSocks,2020-12-25T07:18:39Z,5,"Excellent no hassle process, they look great and delivered to Australia highly recommend"
PupSocks,2020-12-25T07:13:57Z,1,"Ordered Nov 20th. And as of Dec 24th I have not received my order.  Customer service has not been helpful. And while I have waited empty handed for five weeks and counting, I continued to get emails and ads saying “place your order now and receive in time for Christmas,” which was obviously incorrect.  Very disappointed."
PupSocks,2020-12-25T07:12:01Z,2,"I ordered twice from PupSocks, and had a poor “customer experience” both times.My first order was for a custom blanket for my daughter with her dog’s image on it. A couple of weeks after ordering, I received an email saying my order had shipped. When I received a package from PupSocks, I opened it to find that it was a pair of socks with rabbit images on them. Clearly not my order. I contacted the company to let them know. They initiated a new order, and I eventually received the blanket.My second order was for a custom mask, again with images of my daughter’s dog. As I write this on Christmas Eve - weeks after placing my order - the mask has still not arrived. It was to be a Christmas gift. I’m very disappointed.Lesson learned I guess."
PupSocks,2020-12-25T06:12:54Z,4,"I ordered a blanket. It is soft, warm and good quality. The pictures of my puppies are on point. The only thing I didn’t like was that it took almost a month to arrive."
PupSocks,2020-12-25T06:00:55Z,1,"This was a horrible experience. I ordered 3 weeks before my wifes birthday. Site said 2 day shipping, 1 was even fine with 3-5. I messaged the company a week before I needed them to check on my order. I got an apology a discount and a promise they would ship in 2 days. 2 weeks later I reached out again and was told it would ship in 2 days. Never did get my order. This was one of the biggest headaches ever as far as a online order. I feel bad for anybody that places a order through you guys."
PupSocks,2020-12-25T06:00:18Z,1,Delayed! Delayed! Delayed!  STILL not received!! Ordered weeks ago - believed the ad of “fast turnaround” - Won’t be received for Christmas. Bummer.
PupSocks,2020-12-25T05:35:46Z,1,This company seems to be fraudulent ! Ordered a dog photo blanket day after Thanksgiving . Promised delivery 1 week from ordering ?!Cute website ?! So many choices ?! So accommodating ?! Christmas Day . Still not received ! Tracking number has been “stuck” in the same place for three weeks !! Not the first time of complaints ! Read better business bureau website ! Do Not Order from this company ! Will have Amex track them down ! Pathetic that they use animals to rip people off !
PupSocks,2020-12-25T05:27:27Z,2,Three weeks and I never received my sons Christmas present
PupSocks,2020-12-25T05:25:09Z,1,Ordered my item on Nov.19th and I still haven’t received. Sent two emails regarding this and never got a response. I understand times are hard and it takes longer to receive orders. However you gave me an time window and it didn’t arrive in that time and still hasn’t.
PupSocks,2020-12-25T05:25:08Z,1,Did not receive socks.Dont know where they are and most likely will be our last order ever.thanks     Chad
PupSocks,2020-12-25T05:10:39Z,5,Wonderful. I couldn't be happier.
PupSocks,2020-12-25T05:04:59Z,1,I ordered November 27 and the order hasn’t shipped yet. They finally sent an email tonight (dec 24) with a mock up and it’s incorrect. I specifically ordered two faces and only one is one the mock-up. I paid extra for two faces. Terrible costumer service.
PupSocks,2020-12-25T05:04:06Z,2,"Order took long time to ship. Once received, my dog is white but on the blanket he looks yellow. Very disappointed"
PupSocks,2020-12-25T04:59:16Z,1,Ordered socks on December 16th and didn't receive by Christmas.
PupSocks,2020-12-25T04:53:38Z,1,Still have bot received my order
PupSocks,2020-12-25T04:49:50Z,1,"I ordered in November and I still do not have my order as if December 24th! Yet,  you are asking me how I like my product??? What product? No response to repeated requests to speak to a live person. So disappointed after so much money spent over the past few years. Prob not again!"
PupSocks,2020-12-25T04:48:06Z,4,The visual quality of the product is excellent. The ordering process is pleasant and customization options are easy to navigate. The only reason I am not rating 5 stars because the materials doesn’t feel like it will be comfortable. I bought for a gift so I have not worn them myself but I don’t imagine them to be comfortable. They are a fun novelty item though so I’m still happy with my purchase.
PupSocks,2020-12-25T04:47:43Z,1,Ordered a month ago.  Haven’t received order and no response from email to customer service.
PupSocks,2020-12-25T04:46:27Z,2,Did not look anything like the pic I sent in.
PupSocks,2020-12-25T04:29:54Z,4,"Print came great. Material is high quality, but not as soft as I hoped"
PupSocks,2020-12-25T04:05:20Z,1,Still awaiting my order which has now missed Xmas so they did not arrive as the present I wanted them to be and have had no reply from the company to my enquiry
PupSocks,2020-12-25T03:55:17Z,5,I bought these for my son to remember our dog whom we had for 20 years and passed away this fall. My son loved them.
PupSocks,2020-12-25T03:53:47Z,1,My order never arrived and I can’t even get a response from Pupsocks. I made an order over a month ago and have had none of my emails or messages on social media responded to. It seems like it might be a con and not a legit company
PupSocks,2020-12-25T03:43:32Z,1,I STILL have not received what I ordered!! I don’t want a “mock up” I want what I ordered for A Christmas gift! Now I am not going to be able to give it. And the COVID excuse is over used and lame! Where is my order?!
PupSocks,2020-12-25T03:38:36Z,5,I got a blanket for my other half of all of our babies!!! He loved it!!!
PupSocks,2020-12-25T03:36:04Z,5,Got the socks for Christmas gifts and they are just adorable.  I loved giving them and the people getting them loved getting them.  Who doesn’t love their pet enough to have the pic on their socks.  Such a great idea!!
PupSocks,2020-12-25T03:15:51Z,1,Ordered 30+ days ago. No order tracking. Nothing received. Unresponsive to emails.
PupSocks,2020-12-25T03:08:42Z,1,The socks aren’t as pictured - bad quality made from weird fabric not like normal sock fabric. Disappointing after a longer wait than expected and what I paid.
PupSocks,2020-12-25T02:45:58Z,1,Never received our order for Christmas.
PupSocks,2020-12-25T02:35:39Z,3,Cant say. Has not yet been received.
PupSocks,2020-12-25T02:31:42Z,1,The socks are so stiff and not comfortable at all. I’m so disappointed.  I bought 4 pairs and I don’t think anyone will wear them.
PupSocks,2020-12-24T16:54:35Z,1,"We were so excited to get our Pup Socks, as we’d ordered them as a Christmas gift for a dear friend. Yesterday, there was an empty envelope from Pup Socks in our mailbox, with what looked like a poor seal on the envelope. Now we are faced with finding another gift last minute, with all the stores closed & no time to reorder before Christmas. In addition, Pup Socks has no way to contact them on their website. We are very disappointed."
PupSocks,2020-12-24T16:53:15Z,5,"Love the product, bought socks and masks for my granddaughter.Keep up the good work.p"
PupSocks,2020-12-24T16:48:50Z,5,"Designing the socks was quick and easy, they looked great, and they fit perfectly!"
PupSocks,2020-12-24T16:44:08Z,5,The socks were a better quality than I was expecting and the picture was SO clear! Highly recommend.
PupSocks,2020-12-24T16:42:39Z,5,Awesome product
PupSocks,2020-12-24T16:40:13Z,1,If I could rate this a zero I would. Ordered December 6th. Have yet to receive. Try to contact customer service and get an automated email. None of my order showed up. Still waiting on a refund. Do not order from this joke of a company.
PupSocks,2020-12-24T16:40:11Z,1,"UPDATE - My order, placed on Nov. 27 finally shipped on Dec. 31 and arrived today (Jan. 8). I ordered a total of eight pairs of socks and only received seven and while the pictures were all ones I sent (which I wasn't sure was going to be the case after reading some other people's stories on Facebook about receiving products with someone else's pets/children), I had sent a couple of different photos of the same dog so that people's socks wouldn't be exactly the same, but they used the same two photos over and over instead of using the variety of photos I had specified in my order. The company did take 25% off my order, which I appreciate, but it is not enough to make up for all the problems and I would NEVER use them or recommend them. Waiting to see how long the missing pair of socks takes to resolve. END UPDATE I ordered several pairs of socks for holiday gifts on November 27. The website said one-day production turnaround so I figured I would get them in plenty of time. It has now been 19 business days (27 days total) and my order is still marked as ""in production."" I have not been able to reach anyone at the company. The few boiler plate emails I have received blame the USPS for shipping delays but take no responsibility for their own actions. I know there are horrible shipping delays with USPS this year, but my order hasn't even been shipped. It has been ""in production"" the entire time. In a year that I wanted to make Christmas as ""normal"" as possible for my young niece and nephews and do something that would cheer up my 81-year old mother who will be spending Christmas alone this year and who I haven't seen in person for a year, I thought I would have a cute, creative gift. While my credit card was billed immediately, I have no socks, no information and no chance of having the gifts for Christmas. And it seems the company does this every year. I wish I had done more research - and chosen a different company."
PupSocks,2020-12-24T16:26:36Z,1,My ranking was bad for the following reasons1. I did not receive my item2. Trying to reach out to customer service was extremely difficult 3. After I finally got someone to respond to my email about not receiving my package the time frame was too long4. I will not receive my order that was a Xmas stocking stuffer in time.
PupSocks,2020-12-24T16:25:12Z,1,"Not great, I ordered 2 pairs of pup socks and have only received 1. I have written several times and the only thing I have received is more advertising to buy more socks! I was so excited to these to my CHILDREN for Christmas but now I only have a pair for one. Very disappointed."
PupSocks,2020-12-24T16:22:56Z,3,"Good novelty product.  Very expensive for what it is, and the sizes are WAAY off bt is good fun, and the print quality is decent."
PupSocks,2020-12-24T16:22:08Z,5,This is a great idea and the socks are super cute
PupSocks,2020-12-24T16:08:41Z,5,They customized based on my specific request and turnaround time was excellent!  Finished product is adorable and my husband loved his birthday present.
PupSocks,2020-12-24T16:03:05Z,4,"The socks are so cute.  Bought this set for my sister in law, I think she'll love them.  Looking forward to ordering more for my other siblings with pets."
PupSocks,2020-12-24T15:56:05Z,1,"I am still waiting for my socks 5-6 weeks after ordering, which is the reason for the 1 star rating.  Looks like they aren't going to make it in time for Christmas, which was the whole point of ordering!Very Disappointing!!!"
PupSocks,2020-12-24T15:54:33Z,1,Did not follow directions for pictures on mask.And now get a generic automated response when emailing them blaming the USPS on my messed up order not arriving!
PupSocks,2020-12-24T15:50:32Z,5,Got them for someone as a gift. Delivery to Canada took approximately 4 weeks but that's to be expected at these crazy Christmas times of 2020. Can't wait to see his face when he opens the package. Customer service was very responsive even during these very busy times. Way to go team! Thank you thank you thank you!
PupSocks,2020-12-24T15:47:08Z,5,I can’t wait for my daughter to open this present! It exceeded my expectations!
PupSocks,2020-12-24T15:41:35Z,5,Great service... my order was delayed due to the postal service and PupSocks stayed in touch with me every step of the way.
PupSocks,2020-12-24T15:40:01Z,5,The blanket we got was super soft and had perfect placement of our dog. My son loved it!!!
PupSocks,2020-12-24T15:37:17Z,1,"I ordered the socks on November 19 and it's December 24 and they're still not here. This was the second time that I received a request to review the product that I have not received. The first time I asked for help and only got an automated response. No customer service. No Christmas gift. ☹I also received an email within the last 2 weeks saying there was still time to order Christmas gifts from them. However, the order I placed more than a month ago isn't making it."
PupSocks,2020-12-23T20:04:05Z,4,"Amazing looking socks, one complain is that the material isn’t as soft as I thought it would be"
PupSocks,2020-12-23T20:03:50Z,1,Shipping company you use very rude and no help ordered for Christmas in November and still not here! Reached out to you no reply
PupSocks,2020-12-23T19:58:20Z,5,Excellent product - the print quality was great and the shipping to Australia was pretty rapid for this time of year. I would buy again.
PupSocks,2020-12-23T19:58:00Z,1,Never received order and was promised it would order before the holidays! Do not do business with this company!
PupSocks,2020-12-23T19:56:50Z,5,I’m sure the folks I bought these will enjoy having their fur babies pictured on their socks.
PupSocks,2020-12-23T19:54:43Z,5,I was pleased with my two orders (one for my daughter and one for my neighbor - one catsocks and one pupsocks).  I will see how they react when they open these Christmas presents!!!  They are really cute!
PupSocks,2020-12-23T19:52:23Z,1,I never received the socks I ordered!
PupSocks,2020-12-23T19:52:01Z,5,"The socks have sort of a weird fit, but the pictures came out better than expected! A great gift for anyone that loves their pets!"
PupSocks,2020-12-23T19:51:14Z,5,"I asked for an especial request to crop the image of a car instead of a face, and it end up perfect!!! It's a classic car that makes great socks :)"
PupSocks,2020-12-23T19:49:36Z,5,These were fantastic!!!! I cnanot wait for my brother to open them!
PupSocks,2020-12-23T19:46:38Z,1,Socks never arrived and customer service will not respond to any emails. I ordered over an month ago and have been provided with no tracking confirmation.
PupSocks,2020-12-23T19:45:24Z,1,"It is hard to give a star when I am still waiting for the product which was ordered a month ago.  I’m optimistic I will be pleased, but shipping is an issue during a pandemic and Christmas!"
PupSocks,2020-12-23T19:45:08Z,1,The socks haven’t arrived.
PupSocks,2020-12-23T19:43:47Z,4,"Socks arrived and looked fantastic. Ordering process was simple, too. Only concern is that shipping took quite some time - with no updates received. Fortunately it did arrive in time for Christmas."
PupSocks,2020-12-23T19:43:05Z,2,Put in my order in November so that it would be there in time for Christmas and it still has not arrived.
PupSocks,2020-12-23T19:42:43Z,2,"Image on socks is cute but these socks aren’t comfortably wearable.  They do not fit to your foot at all.  Baggy in the toe and rolls of fabric around the ankle.  Took a long time, got lost in the mail for about 10 days.  Not pupsocks fault, but the there was a severe lack of customer service when I was trying to figure out if should order again to have in time for Christmas.  Do not recommend.  Got a much better quality sock from a different company."
PupSocks,2020-12-23T19:42:03Z,5,"Amazing socks!!They turned out so great, very detailed! I'm so obsessed!"
PupSocks,2020-12-23T19:40:55Z,4,For socks for my sister-in-law. Cute! Look just like the picture.
PupSocks,2020-12-23T19:40:23Z,1,Disappointed. I waited for such a long time for them to arrive and discovered that they sent me the wrong socks with the wrong dog and strangers faces. Worst is that no one has ever gotten back to me to fix the problem.  Epic fail.
PupSocks,2020-12-23T19:37:06Z,5,I ordered these socks for a Christmas gift and they turned out great!!  The quality of the socks and graphics exceeded my expectations.
